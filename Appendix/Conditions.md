# Conditions

<sup>Click [here](/Core_Rules/Encounters_and_Abilities#conditions) for the rules on conditions.</sup>

---

#### Blind

Blinded characters suffer a disadvantage to all rolls that require that character to attack, interact with, brandish, or use special abilities at, a specified target. This does not count for interacting with or brandishing their own personal items. In addition to this, all terrain is difficult to move across.

---

#### Bloodied

Bloodied is condition that simply describes the state of a character's health. If you have a negative amount of health then you are considered bloodied. This effect exists in contrast to the [wounded](#wounded) condition.

---

#### Burning

Burning objects are dangerous and likely to cause nearby objects to continue to burn if not contained or extinguished. Burning characters suffer damage over time.

When applied to a character, burning is an condition that has a numerical value. If a burning character has burning applied to them, add the burning values together. At the beginning of a burning character's turn, they take fire damage equal to the burning value which is then decreased by 1. Burning 1 would be 1 damage, while burning 3 would be 3 damage (then 2, then 1). Damage from burning bypasses all damage reduction. When the burning value is reduced to 0, the burning ends.

Typically, dousing a target in water will completely remove the burning (including magical fire), unless the source of burning is specifically not water extinguishable (like an oil or grease fire).

#### Debilitation

A debilitation is a condition that applies to one of your stats. Debilitated stats are rolled with disadvantage. Multiple debilitations to the same stat do not stack (you only suffer one degree of disadvantage from debilitation).

---

#### Dying

When a character is given the dying condition they also get the [unconscious](#unconscious) condition. At the start of each turn that a character is dying, they must make a fortitude check versus a difficulty value equal to their negative health. If that character succeeds three times, they lose the dying condition, but remain unconscious. If they fail three times, they die. Criticals count as two successes, and grazes count as neither a success or failure. Successes and failures do not need to be consecutive. Stabilized characters remain at negative health. At the end of every round that a character is dying they lose one more health.

---

#### Encumbered

Encumbered characters are carrying too much. They get a disadvantage to both strength and dexterity, and have halved speed.

---

#### Enhancement

An enhancement is a condition that applies to one of your stats. Enhanced stats are rolled with advantage. Multiple enhancements to the same stat do not stack (you only get one degree of advantage from enhancement).

---

#### Overencumbered

Overencumbered characters suffer the same effects as encumbered characters, but instead of moving at half speed, they cannot move at all.

---

#### Poison

Poison is a condition that has a numerical value and a trigger duration. At the end of each trigger duration that a character is poisoned, they must make a fortitude check to resist the poison. If no difficulty or trigger duration are specified, they are assumed to be 15 (moderate) and one day. The result of the fortitude check determines how the poison progresses:

***Critical:*** Lose no health, and reduce the poison value by 1.  
***Success:*** Lose health equal to half of the poison value (rounded up), then reduce the poison value by 1.  
***Graze:*** Lose health equal to the poison value, then reduce the poison value by 1.  
***Failure:*** Lose health equal to the poison value, but do not reduce the poison value.

---

#### Prone

Prone characters are either kneeling or laying down on the ground. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. You must spend one action to stand up from being prone.

---

#### Sickness

Sickness is a condition that has a numerical value. This value is a penalty that you take to *all* of your rolls. Additionally, every day that passes while you are sick you lose health (after recovery, if applicable) equal to half of the sickness value (rounded up). Stamina, focus, and endurance recovered during breaks and rests is also reduced by half this value (rounded up) to a minimum of one.

For example: If you have sickness 3 and you take a rest, you will recover 1 health, then lose 2. You will also recover 2 less stamina, focus, and endurance.

Multiple sickness effects do not add their value together, instead only apply a penalty based on the strongest sickness value. Multiple sources of sickness are still tracked separately even if only one is taking effect.

If a sickness effect does not specify a duration, roll r20 to determine the duration in days. At the end of each day, the sickened character gets to make a fortitude check to resist the sickness. If no difficulty is specified, it is assumed to be 10 (easy). The result of the foritude check determines how the sickness progresses:

***Critical:*** The duration is reduced by half (rounded down) instead of a single day, and the sickness value is reduced by 1 (if reduced to 0, the sickness ends prematurely).  
***Success:*** The duration is reduced by half (rounded down) instead of a single day.  
***Graze:*** A single day of the duration is passed.  
***Failure:*** No duration of the sickness is passed.

#### Stunned

At the beginning of a stunned character's turn, they lose the stunned effect and one action. Until then, stunned characters cannot perform reactions. A character can become stunned multiple times, causing them to lose more actions at the beginning of their turn. Regardless of how many times a character is stunned, they will entirely lose the stun effect when their turn begins. For example: A character manages to become stunned four times before their next turn. At the beginning of their turn they will lose four actions (more than their whole turn), and no longer be stunned. They may still perform a free action.

If a character is in the middle of an action or readying an action and they become stunned, then that action becomes interrupted and will not be performed.

If a character is maintaining concentration on an ability when they become stunned, then they lose concentration on that ability.

---

#### Unconscious

Unconscious characters cannot perform actions. Loud noises or other disrupting behaviour may awaken an unconscious individual. When a character becomes unconscious they also become prone.

---

#### Wounded

Wounded is condition that simply describes the state of a character's health. If you have less than your maximum health then you are considered wounded. This effect exists in contrast to the [bloodied](#bloodied) condition.
