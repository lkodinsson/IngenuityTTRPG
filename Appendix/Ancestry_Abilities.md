#### Adaptation

Provides a +1 bonus to any one specified skill, but at the cost of a -1 penalty to another specified skill.

---

#### Brave

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature gets a +2 bonus to willpower to resist any effects that would cause them fear.

---

#### Construct

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature's body is constructed of various artificial materials and does not perform normal biological functions. They are immune to being sick (like poison and disease), no longer require food or sleep, and do not recover 1 health after a rest. They may be repaired during a rest using the craft skill the same way a normal creature would using the medicine skill. Additionally, if they would be repaired by a power (like the [Mend](/Features/Powers#mend) power), they also recover an additional 1 health.

The creature also gets natural armour as a part of its body, which can be modified like any other armour, or replaced by any other metal armour type. This natural armour only applies its armour rating and damage reduction if they are greater than any body armour that they are also wearing. By default the natural armour provides 2 armour rating and damage reduction. This armour is treated as having a cost of 70 for the purposes of crafting upgrades onto it. This armour considered to be a part of its body, is not considered to be worn.

---

#### Fungal Body

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature cannot speak normally, but can speak mentally to any living thing they are directly touching, as long as the recipient is willing. This communication does not require that both creatures speak the same languages, but some may find it intrusive. The sporecap on their head prevents them from wearing any kind of headgear, but they can emit spores to identify the position of nearby creatures regardless of lighting conditions.

---

#### Graceful

**Point Cost:** 2

Provides a +1 bonus to agility and athletics checks when leaping, running, climbing, or evading.

---

#### Grit

---

#### Iron Gut

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature gets a +2 bonus to fortitude to resist any effects that would make them sick (such as poison, disease, or drinking alcohol).

---

#### Lucky

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature gets a +1 bonus to its luck rolls.

---

#### Magical

**Point Cost:** 2 to 4

The creature is magical in its very nature. Any natural armour and weapons the creature has are considered magical, and the creature gains the ability to cast one or more spell powers. The number of ancestry points on this ability determines the number of spells granted. One, two, or three spells are granted if 2, 3, or 4 points are spent, respectively. When casting a spell power granted by this ancestry ability, intelligence and resolve are rolled together instead of the normal skill check. A luck roll is still made when using a spell power in this way.

---

#### Natural Armour

**Point Cost:** 1 to 4

The creature 

<!--
The creature gains a defensive bonus from a specified natural armour as listed below. The natural armour only applies its armour rating and damage reduction if they are greater than any body armour that the creature is also wearing.

##### Table: Natural Body Armours
| Name | Point<br/>Cost | Armour<br/>Rating | Damage<br/>Reduction |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Hide | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Thick Hide<br/>or Carapace | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| Scales | 3 | 4 | 4 |
-->

As an additional cost the creature may also gain one or more of the bonuses listed below. These bonuses always apply, even if the creature is wearing body armour.

##### Table: Natural Additional Armours
| Name | Point<br/>Cost | Features |
|:-|:-:|:-|
| Horns | 1 | Parry 3, cannot wear head armour (except for hoods which do not hide the horns) unless it is [custom fitted](/Appendix/Equipment_Properties#custom-fit) |
| Shell | 1 | +2 armour rating and damage reduction when attacked from behind |

---

#### Natural Talent

**Point Cost:** 1 to 3

The creature gains any talent as if it was an ancestry ability. The point cost of this ability depends on the experience cost of the talent.

##### Table: Natural Talent Cost
| Talent<br/>Cost | Point<br/>Cost |
|:-:|:-:|
| 4+ | 1 |
| 8+ | 2 |
| 12+ | 3 |

If that creature later spends experience points to acquire that talent again (if possible) they are treated as if they didn't already have that talent for the purpose of calculating additional experience costs, and it can only be advanced to its normal limit. For example: If the creature has Toughness (+4) from Natural Talent and the creature advances it, then it will only cost 4 experience (instead of 6) because it is the first time it is spending experience on it and it can still only be advanced to its normal limit of +12.

---

#### Natural Weapon

**Point Cost:** 1

The creature gains up to two weapons from the natural weapons table below:

##### Table: Natural Weapons

| Dark | 1 | The creature can see in both areas devoid of light and poorly lit areas with ease, but cannot see in broad daylight. |
