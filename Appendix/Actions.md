#### Attack

**Action Type:** One Action

Make an attack against a target with a weapon or your bare hands. To make an attack, make a combat check using the weapon's stat and skill against the target's deflection. Then if the result is greater than or equal to your target's deflection, the attack has hit and is considered a success, dealing the weapon's damage to the target minus their damage reduction. Otherwise, the attack misses and is a failure. Damage dealt is first taken to endurance, and the excess to health.

You also get 1 bonus damage for every multiple of 2 that your attack roll exceeds the target's deflection. The minimum amount of damage that can be dealt by a successful hit is 1 damage.

If your luck roll is greater than or equal to the weapon's critical threshold, also add its critical bonus to your weapon damage and the attack cannot miss. If your attack roll is less than the target's deflection in this way, reduce any damage you would deal for every multiple of 2 that your attack roll is lower than the target's deflection.

For example: You make an attack with a knife, which uses dexterity and finesse. If your dexterity is a d6 and your finesse is a d4, you will roll d6+d4 for the attack (plus a luck roll). If you succeed on your luck roll the knife will add its critical bonus of 6 to its base damage of 3 for a total of 9. If you rolled a 10 on your combat check and the target has a deflection of 4, then the attack has exceeded by 6, providing 3 bonus damage for a total of 12.

If your weapon is thrown or fires a projectile and your target is within 1m of other characters, then there is a chance to hit those characters instead of your intended target. If your luck roll results in a 1 or less, then apply your attack roll to one of those adjacent characters at random instead.

<!--Attacks made by weapons with the nonlethal feature cause a creature to be given the unconscious condition instead of the dying condition when applicable. If nonlethal attacks bring a character to negative health equal to their maximum health, then they are still given the dying condition.-->

Each additional attack gets a -3 penalty for each attack made before it during the same turn. This penalty applies to all forms of attack actions (such as maneuvers) except for reactions. This is known as the *multiple attack penalty*.

Attacks made against enemies who cannot see you, or who are surrounded on two opposite sides, are made with advantage. These are known as *sneak attacks* and *flanking attacks* respectively. You do not need to be contributing to a flank to make a flanking attack (such as making a ranged attack against a flanked target). If you make an attack that is both a sneak attack and a flanking attack it will provide you double advantage on that attack roll.

#### Block

**Action Type:** Free Reaction

If an attack in front of you would deal you damage, you may use a brandished shield with the block property to absorb the damage first. If you do, the shield is considered to be hit instead of you. Reduce the incoming damage by the shield's block value, then deal the remaining damage to the shield's durability. The minimum amount of damage that can be dealt in this way is 1 damage. Any effects that apply from being hit are given to your shield instead of you if possible. Otherwise, they cause no effect.

If the shield would be dealt damage from an attack in excess of its durability, that excess damage is dealt directly to you as though it was from a successful hit. Shields with zero durability are considered broken and cannot be used to block until they are repaired. Repairing a shield requires using the craft skill, with the cost being equal to the missing durability multiplied by 2.

---

#### Brandish

**Action Type:** One Action

Choose what you are wielding in both of your hands. This can be items from your inventory, or items found in your immediate area. Releasing wielded items and objects does not cost an action.

At the beginning of an encounter, each participant may take this action for free (during the first round that they can take actions).

---

#### Drop Prone

**Action Type:** Free Action

You become prone. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. While prone your movement speed is halved. 

<!-- Possible alternate text: "Attacks made at a range of 3m or greater against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but attacks made within 1m are made with advantage." -->

---

#### Evade

**Action Time:** Free Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

You may make an agility check to defend against an attack instead of using your deflection. If the luck roll is successful, then double the result of your agility check. If your agility check results in less than your reflexes, then use your reflexes instead.

After you evade, you may drop prone, seek cover, and/or move up to 1m. Moving in this way is a reaction.

---

#### Interact

**Action Type:** Variable

This action covers most basic tasks, like opening doors, activating items, or using objects in the immediate area. Unless an object specifies, or a task requires an extended amount of time to perform, this action is considered to be one action. An item or object can be brandished for free as a part of using this action.

---

#### Move

**Action Type:** One Action

Move a distance up to your speed. If you move only 1m, this is considered a free action. Additionally, this action costs 1 stamina if it is not the first time you have used it during your turn.

If the terrain you are moving over is rough or difficult to navigate, then you can only move half as far over that terrain. If your speed is 1m or less, you can still move at least 1m over difficult terrain for each move action. Movement limited in this way to only 1m cannot be performed as a free action (as per the above rule). This includes moving only 1m if your movement speed is reduced to 2m or less.

---

#### Parry

**Action Type:** Free Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

Use a wielded item with the parry property to defend against an attack by making a luck roll with a bonus equal to your reflexes. If the luck roll is successful, add the parry value to your deflection. Otherwise, add only half of the parry value (rounded down).

Shields that are already broken cannot be used to parry.

---

#### Ready an Action

**Action Type:** Two Actions

Declare any action with an action type of two actions or less to instead use as a reaction given a specified trigger of your choice. Readied actions when triggered are performed immediately, even if that means they might happen in the middle of, or before, another action. This can include maneuvers, powers, or any other special abilities or actions. If an attack or maneuver is readied by this action, then it is effected by the multiple attack penalty as if it was taken during your turn (normally reactions are not affected by the multiple attack penalty). For example: while standing at the end of a hallway, you can ready an attack action against any targets that come into view (such as from a room attached to that hallway).

This action may only be taken as your last action during your turn.

---

#### Rise from Prone

**Action Type:** One Action

You cancel the effects of prone. Ranged and melee attacks against you are made as normal, and your movement speed is restored.

---

#### Seek Cover

**Action Type:** One Action

If you are next to a barricade, the edge of a wall, or some similar structure, you can seek cover behind that object. While being provided cover, you are considered to be partially concealed from ranged enemies until your next turn, giving disadvantage to ranged combat checks and powers made against you.

You may instead take this action as a free action if you have moved more than once during your turn. If you do, you do not need to hide behind an obstacle to get the benefits; it is as though you are using your speed and movement to avoid being targeted from a distance.

---

#### Use a Skill

**Action Type:** Variable

Skills can be performed as normal during any type of encounter. The exact duration that a skill takes to perform is the same as it would be during any complex challenge. Some skills may take more than a few minutes to complete. This means that most characters who attempt to use complex skills during an encounter may find themselves unable to perform other actions until the action is completed (unless they abandon their attempt).
