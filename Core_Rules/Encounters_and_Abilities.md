# Encounters and Abilities

## Encounters

Encounters are time-sensitive scenarios where each action you take matters. Encounters typically begin in a few different ways:

* If two or more characters or creatures intend to perform actions that oppose each other (combat and non-combat).
* When a character is aware of a potential danger, and intends to be deliberate and calculating with their actions.
* When there is limited time to overcome a complex challenge.

Encounters from start to end follow this sequence:

1. All characters and creatures will compare their reflexes to determine which team goes first.
2. If some participants are surprised by combat, the aggressors may take turns during a surprise round.
3. After the surprise round (if any), all teams take turns alternating with one character each, until all characters have acted. This then repeats until the encounter ends.

#### Initiative

When it comes time to begin an encounter each character will compare their *reflexes* which is determined by their passive *dexterity* and *resolve*. The team with the highest individual initiative goes first. On a tie, the player team goes first. Each team will take turns choosing one character to act, and will alternate teams one character each until all characters have acted. Players can choose to take their turns in any order, and may change the order in which they take their turns during each subsequent round. For example: Four players attempt to sneak up on two guards. They fail to be stealthy and alert the guards who begin to attack the players. All six characters will roll for initiative. One of the players rolled the highest initiative so their team will go first. Player #1 will act, then Guard #1, Player #2, Guard #2, Player #3, and finally Player #4. Because there were only two guards, their team did not have any additional characters to take turns between Players #3 and #4.

#### Rounds

Each round represents about six seconds in the game world, meaning there are 10 rounds in a minute. During each round each character will be able perform multiple actions. When an effect refers to a number of rounds, this means from the start of a character's the turn in which that effect began until the start of their turn in a future round, but before they take any actions. If the effected character is removed from taking turns in the encounter then that effect triggers at the end of the round after all other characters have taken their actions.

In other cases, encounters which can be better described as complex challenges do not require an exact duration of a player's turn. Instead, there is simply a series of challenges to overcome in a given time frame. In this way, players are simply performing a series of skill checks in addition to any other actions (assuming all player's spend roughly the same amount of time) and taking turns doing so.

<!-- The most basic combat scenarios may be considered complex challenges rather than tactical combat encounters if the results of that combat have minimal consequences. This can allow those combats to be more narrative than tactical. In these situations it is more common for simple enemies to go down in a single hit, while elite enemies will require more significant damage before becoming defeated. -->
<!-- The above information is probably more useful in a GMG rather than here. -->

## Actions

During an encounter with concrete turn length (such as tactical combat) you can perform up to three [actions](/Appendix/Actions) during your turn, with some tasks requiring the cost of multiple of these actions to be performed. Actions that are longer than a single turn (more than three actions) are considered *extended actions*. When an extended action is started, it may be cancelled at any point during one of your future turns before it finishes. Basically, you can begin actions with any action cost (including more than you have available), but they only resolve when the full action cost is paid.

Once during each round when it is not your turn, you may still take certain actions called *reactions* (that is from the start of your turn to the start of your next turn). These types of actions have a trigger condition which allows you to perform them. For example: the *evade* action is a reaction that allows you to make an agility skill check instead of your deflection when you are targeted by an attack.

In addition to actions and reactions, there are also *free actions* and *free reactions*. These types of actions do not take up your actions per turn or reactions per round.

<!--Actions provided from sources like from skills, talents, maneuvers, or powers, will usually list how long they take (as actions) to perform. If they do not, it is up to the Game Master to determine how long they would take given the context of the encounter.-->

Under normal circumstances you will dictate what you do rather than specifying the exact game action you take. In the case of special abilities, these aspects of your character are more under you control. Instead you declare exactly what ability you are using, and then describe what your character does as it performs that action. For example: You might say, *"I jump across the pit,"* which may require you to roll an athletics check to succeed. Alternatively, you could instead say, *"I cast the spell Feather Fall then jump across the pit,"* and it might make it easy enough that you don't need to roll at all.

#### Group Actions

Characters can work together on a task to increase their likelihood of success. In this case, all characters will make the same skill check for that action, and single greatest result will be used. For example: If multiple characters are searching a room for a secret door or hidden object, only one of them needs to succeed, but they must take this action at the same time. During an encounter this can be done by multiple characters readying an action to aid another character when they perform a task.

Additionally, if any one of those characters is at least proficient (d8) in that skill then they will provide the ability of their luck die upgrading failures to success to all other characters that are at least trained (d4) in that skill but not yet proficient. For example: Two characters, one who is proficient (d8) and one who is trained (d4), perform a group action. Even if both characters roll below the difficulty value, if either one of them succeeds their luck roll they can still succeed in the task.

## Concentration

Some abilities or effects may require you to maintain *concentration*. Concentration can only be used to maintain a single ability or effect at a time. If at any point you are required to maintain concentration on multiple effects at once, you must choose one to maintain and the rest to lose. In a way concentration acts like a limited resource, but you never lose the ability to concentrate by spending it.

Concentration requires an active and conscious mind. If at any point you become unconscious, you automatically lose your concentration. If you become stunned, you may make a willpower check against the source that provided the stun. If successful, the concentration is maintained. If the source does not have a difficulty value, then make the check against a difficulty of 9 instead. On a graze, concentration to maintain that effect is reduced to a limited duration of one round (or 6 seconds). If so, the concentration can be reset by reactivating the ability which provided the effect before the duration is met.

## Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, trap, or by any means, they will take damage. Any damage dealt to a character is taken first to their endurance, and then the difference to their health if no endurance remains. When a character is dealt damage, if they would then have zero endurance and are reduced to less than zero health (health can be negative), that character is given the dying condition. If they are reduced to exactly zero health, they are only given the unconscious condition.

Damaging items or objects is done by making the relevant skill checks against a difficulty value based on the perceived difficulty to break that item or object (as determined by the Game Master). For example: breaking a door with an axe could be a martial check against an arbitrary difficulty value (if the door was made of wood, it could be easy).

<!--Damage that is halved or doubled multiple times are modified at an altered rate. If damage would be halved twice, it is instead reduced into a third. If it would be halved again, it is reduced to a quarter, and so on. Similarly, if damage is doubled twice, it is instead increased to a triple. If it would be douled again, it is increased to a quadruple, and so on.-->

#### Damage Types

There are three main categories of damage types: *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless*. The majority of damage is dealt as physical damage, which has three types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. Most sources of damage will deal one of these three types of damage. Most other damage is dealt as elemental damage. The types of elemental damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*. Any time a damage type is not listed as one of the physical or elemental damage types it can be considered typeless damage.

## Conditions

The duration of any given [condition](/Appendix/Conditions) is determined by its source. Unless otherwise specified, most conditions are temporary and multiple conditions of the same type do not stack.

Temporary conditions that alter your primary stats do not also alter your resource stats, they only change derived values that rely on rolling that primary stat (like skill checks). For example: A character with a strength of d6 is given a temporary effect which increasing their strength by +1. This results in a strength of d6+1 which changes their athletics, fortitude, and some combat rolls, but does not change their maximum health from 6 to 7.

In contrast, permanent effects that alter your primary stats do alter your resource stats. For example: If you were given a permanent effect giving you a -1 to your strength, then you would need to reduce your maximum health.

## Maneuvers

[Maneuvers](/Features/Maneuvers) are special abilities acquired by advancing combat skills. Each combat skill has access to different maneuvers, each being considered maneuver specialization. Maneuvers have various types: *offensive*, *defensive*, or *tactical*. Typically, offensive maneuvers perform attacks, defensive maneuvers defend yourself or others, and tactical maneuvers provide special actions.

<!--
#### Acquiring Maneuvers

Whenever you become trained in a new combat skill, you acquire a maneuver from that specialization. These specializations match the combat skills. You gain additional maneuvers for every two rank advancements beyond the first rank in the same skill. Maneuvers cost stamina and can only be used once each round. Any characters that start with combat skills also start with maneuvers based on their advancement in that skill. Maneuvers gained from advancing one combat skill can be used by your other combat skills, so long as they could also be learned by that skill. For example: You advanced your Unarmed skill and learned Heavy Strike. Since you are also trained in Martial, you can also use Heavy Strike with the Martial skill.

-->

#### Performing Maneuvers

Normally, before a maneuver can be performed it must first be learned by advancing the relevant combat skill. This occurs both during character creation and later during character advancement. Performing a maneuver usually has two parts: an attack and an effect. Each maneuver will list the order these things occur and how they interact with the target. Effects can be resisted by the target similar to how attacks can be defended. They will roll the stat or skill listed for the resist against the attack roll. If the resist roll is successful (it exceeds the attack roll) then the additional effects of the maneuver are negated. For example: You perform a Crippling Strike maneuver against a target. First you make an attack, then if the attack hits, the target rolls to resist. If your maneuver's combat roll was a 6 and the defender's resist was a 7, then Crippling Strike applies no additional effect beyond dealing damage from the hit.

#### Improvising Maneuvers

Although maneuvers must normally be learned in order to be used, you may also improvise maneuvers that you have not learned. If you do improvise a maneuver, you perform the maneuver as normal but with an additional cost of your choice: either the stamina cost is increased by 1, or the action type is increased by one action (if possible). For example: You do not have the Feint maneuver, but intend to improvise it. You do not want to waste any stamina, so it takes two actions instead of one action to use.

In essence, all maneuvers are available to all characters, but doing so is very inefficient for the untrained. There are very few maneuvers that cannot be improvised.

## Powers

[Powers](/Features/Powers) function very similarly to maneuvers, but are instead manipulations of reality using either magic or some other kind of supernatural influence. There are various different skills that provide powers and each skill has its own list of specializations that have access to different abilities. Many of these specializations do share some of these abilities which means different sources can provide what are essentially the same supernatural effects, even if one is magic and the other not.

Powers are broken down into tiers which determine both their difficulty to perform and at what skill rank they are allowed to be learned. All powers of the same tier have the same base focus cost and difficulty. Although this is the primary determining factor, some powers have additional rules allowing you to perform them differently which may modify these values. These modifications only change how the power is performed, and not what tier they belong to.

##### Table: Power Tiers
| Tier | Tier Name | Focus Cost | Difficulty |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Lesser | 1 | 3 (Easy) |
| 2 | Greater | 2 | 6 (Moderate) |
| 3 | Epic | 3 | 9 (Hard) |

#### Performing Powers

Although there are many different ways to acquire powers they are all performed the same way:

1. Wait for the complete action time required to use the power.
2. Make a skill check with your power skill versus the power's difficulty. This includes making a luck roll.
3. Spend focus equal to that power's cost if you succeed. Otherwise, spend only 1 focus.
4. The targets (if any) may roll to resist the effects of that power (if allowed).
5. Perform the effects of that power based on your roll versus the target's resist.

If you succeeded your check against the power's difficulty, then you will perform that power as listed in its description. Each power has unique effects, including an additional or improved effect if you manage a critical success from your luck roll. Failure to perform a power results in no effect. If that power results in an amount of something, like damage or healing, then that amount is equal to the result of your skill check.

If the targets of your power choose to resist the effects, they will roll the stat or skill specified by that spell's resist against your skill check for that power. If the targets are also provided future opportunities to resist, they will continue to be made against the same result. Unless a power states otherwise, all effects of that power are negated if the skill check fails against the resist.

Additional powers used during the same turn get a -3 penalty for each power used before it in the same turn. This is known as the *multiple power penalty*. Powers used as a reaction are exempt from this penalty (such as by a readied action).

## Recovering

At some point during an adventure you may find yourself low on your resources and you will need to spend time taking a *break* or a *rest* to recover them. Breaks and rests recover different amounts of each of your resources, and require different amounts of time to complete. Breaks are short and easy to take anywhere, but rests require significant amounts of time and relative safety.

<!-- different amounts of each of your resources, either by half or to full respectively, except for health which only recovers 1 during a rest.-->

<!-- as determined by your *fortitude*, *reflexes*, and *willpower*. When you take a rest, the amount you recover is equal to your related stat, but during a break it is half of this amount (rounded up). For example: if you have a fortitude of 7 then half of that would be 4.

##### Table: Recovery Rates
| Resource | Break | Rest |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Health | None | 1 |
| Endurance | Half of Fortitude | Fortitude |
| Stamina | Half of Reflexes | Reflexes |
| Focus | Half of Willpower | Willpower |

If the amount of a resource recovered would be greater than the maximum amount you can have of that type, you will recover up to your maximum instead. For example: If you have a maximum stamina of 6, but your reflexes is a 7, then you will only ever recover up to your maximum of 6 stamina during that rest.
-->

#### Breaks

A break is basically a short amount of time to relax from strenuous activity. Whenever you go to relax, meditate, or make simple preparations over a period of thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a break. An extended period of up to two hours containing a single simple activity, such as performing research or crafting an item with a low difficulty (of 3 or less) can also be considered a break.

After a successful break, each of endurance, stamina, and focus recover by half of their maximum (rounded up). For example: if you have a maximum stamina of 7, then you would only recover 4 during a break.

Breaks can only be taken up to two times each day (in between rests).

#### Rests

A rest occurs when you sleep uninterrupted for approximately eight hours.

After a successful rest, each of endurance, stamina, and focus recover to full. Additionally, health recovers by 1 and any abilities that can be used a number of timers per rest are also recovered. If a rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered incomplete and only half of the normal resources are recovered instead. The rest may be resumed within two hours to complete the rest and recover the remaining resources.

Characters with substantial wounds will require substantial rest to recover. Characters may treat the wounds of another character before they take a rest by using the medicine skill against a difficulty of 6 (Moderate). This is increased to 9 (Hard) if that character currently has negative health. If successful, the amount of health that character recovers during that rest is increased by 1 (to 2).

Rests can only be taken once each day (usually at night). Tracking exhaustion for sleepless nights is an [optional rule](/Extended_Systems/Advanced_Ailments#fatigue), but it is recommended.
