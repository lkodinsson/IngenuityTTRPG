# Creating a Character

The process of creating a character is a series of small steps, with each step building a distinct part of your character. Generally the process starts with broad decisions then leads to finer decisions.

As a reminder, whenever you assign any stat or skill a dice value, it does not mean to roll those dice and assign it the resulting value; it means that you assign it the dice value itself. This represents what you roll when you use that stat or skill.

## Archetype, Background, and Ancestry

Archetypes and backgrounds get you on the path to building a character with a strong theme, but they do not limit what your character can become. Essentially they are titles that provides you with some benefits and determine your starting skills and abilities. Archetypes are the strongest aspect of your character's theming as they represent where you are now as a character. In contrast, backgrounds describe who your character was in the past. Ancestries of a character detail the type of people that they come from, which can be either a broad or specific group of people.

Make sure to ask your Game Master if any archetypes, backgrounds, or ancestries are recommended or restricted based on the content that they have prepared for you.

#### Picking an Archetype

Each [archetype](/Features/Archetypes) starts with a description detailing what type of character they are and what types of situations they excel in.

Each skill listed in each archetype is granted to your character with a starting dice value of d4. Some archetypes also list skill options, denoted as one or more skills with slashes between them. You will choose only one of these skills to obtain. For example: Fighters start with one of the Archery, Finesse, or Martial skills as an option, and all of the Athletics, Charisma, Medicine, and Perception skills. If any of these skills also require you to choose a specialization, that choice is made during this step (such as a combat or power skill).

Next the archetype will list if it provides any [maneuvers](/Features/Maneuvers) or [powers](/Features/Powers) from any of its relevant combat and power skills. You may pick any maneuver or power from their respective lists as long as you meet the requirements (such as specialization) of those abilities. For example: Wizards start with one wizardry spell power. First you will choose your wizardry specialization as listed in the skill, then you will choose one spell power available to that specialization. Because we are a new character, this is necessarily limited to only tier 1 (lesser) powers. Maneuvers are not limited by tiers.

After maneuvers and powers, archetypes list their provided [talents](/Features/Talents) as additional abilities. Very few talents also require choices, but if they do they are also made during this step.

Archetypes will also list a stat requirement. We will not fulfill the requirements during this step, but we should at least make a note of it.

#### Picking a Background

Similar to archetypes, [backgrounds](/Features/Backgrounds) start with a description of what type of character they are. Backgrounds in this way act as an additional layer of character history, detailing who your character was before they became your chosen archetype. This history limits what and who your character can know with the knowledge and contacts skills.

Each background provides a small benefit as a +1 bonus to two different skills. Whether you do or do not have those skills provided to you by your archetype, you will still receive the +1 bonus.

#### Picking an Ancestry

[Ancestries](/Features/Ancestries) are widely encompassing of identity, culture, or heritage, with each listing providing a brief description detailing the general nature of those type of characters. Each ancestry has several unique abilities along with a few general stats like size and modifiers to one or more primary stats. Keep a note of the modifiers to primary stats until they are determined in the next step.

The size of an ancestry is an important quality determining overall effectiveness of strength and relative dexterity compared to other creatures, but it also is a rough guideline for the measurements of a character. The size table below lists examples of creatures at each size category to help create a frame of reference to understand exactly how big a size really is. Most ancestries will likely be of a medium size (5).

##### Table: Size Details
| Size | Size Name | Average<br/>Longest<br>Dimension | Average<br/>Weight | Examples |
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|:-|
| 1 | Very Tiny | <nobr>less than</nobr><br/>¼m | <nobr>less than</nobr><br/>1kg | Crow, Garden Snake, Mouse, Rabbit, Squirrel |

## Stats

Stats are primarily numerical properties of a character, most of which are derived from your primary stats. You will get to choose the distribution among your primary stats, which will allow you to calculate the rest of your stats.

### Primary Stats

The four primary stats of *strength*, *dexterity*, *intelligence*, and *resolve* each affect different derived secondary stats and skills. At a baseline, the archetype that you have chosen has a stat requirement which serves as a suggestion of the most important stat for that archetype. However, so long as the stat requirement is met you may distribute your primary stats as you desire.

Among your stats you will choose two of them to be *good* and two of them to be *weak*. The stats that are assigned a value of good become a d6, while the ones that are assigned a value of weak become a d4. The maximum value (including the bonuses from your ancestry) will be how you meet requirements using those stats. For example: If your archetype has a stat requirement of strength to be at least 5, then a d4+1 or a d6 would meet this requirement but just a d4 would not.

### Secondary Stats

At this step, mostly you will mostly be calculating the remaining stats of your character rather than making any real choices.

#### Resources

Characters have the four resources of *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, with each being equal to the maximum value of their related primary stats. For example: Your health is equal to your maximum strength, and if you have a strength of d6+1 then you would have a health of 7.

##### Table: Resource Stats
| Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Health (HP) | Maximum STR |
| Endurance (ED) | Maximum RES |
| Stamina (ST) | Maximum DEX |
| Focus (FP) | Maximum INT |

If your ancestry also has the ability called *grit*, then each of those resources are also increased by an additional 1.

#### Defenses

The are four defensive stats of *fortitude*, *reflexes*, *willpower*, and *deflection*, with each relying on the passive values of your primary stats. As a reminder, the passive value of a stat is equal to half of its maximum roll, plus or minus any modifiers. For example: With a resolve of d6+1, you would have a passive value of 3 plus 1 for a total of 4.

Each defensive stat is a combination of passive resolve and another passive value as demonstrated by the following table. For example: Fortitude is equal to your passive resolve and passive strength. With a resolve of d6 and a strength of d6+1, you would have a fortitude of 7.

##### Table: Defensive Stats
| Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Fortitude (FORT) | Passive RES + Passive STR |
| Reflexes (REFL) | Passive RES + Passive DEX |
| Willpower (WILL) | Passive RES + Passive INT |
| Deflection (DEFL) | Passive RES + Armour Rating |

Deflection is a special exception of the defensive stats. It relies on the passive value of only one of your primary stats but it is also affected by the armour rating from any armour that you equip. For example: If you were wearing some leather armour which has an armour rating of 2, if you also have a resolve of d6, then the total value of your deflection would be 5.

#### Speed

Your speed determines how many meters your character can move every 2 seconds (or one action during an encounter). It is determined by taking the size of your character and adding 1 with some ancestries providing an additional modifier. For example: If your character was medium sized (5), then your speed would be 6m. If your ancestry was fast, then you would add an additional 1 for a total of 7m.

## Personalization

The most important defining feature of a character is their personality. What makes your character different? What makes your character worth playing? What about your character allows you to explore the world in unique way? Not every character needs to be completely novel, but by understanding who your character is supposed to be can help you and other players understand how they fit into the game world.

### Motivation

A character's motivation is the primary driving force for why characters make their decisions. It can be described in a few sentences or less. Ultimately it will be a source of both conflict and cooperation as characters will need to make decisions that fulfill their motivations sometimes in contrast to the motivations of others.

Character motivations must answer two questions: What does the character want? And why does the character want it? Optionally, other details may be provided to help explain these answers. For example: Your character could desire wealth because they want to retire living the life they believe they deserve. The might also seek to provide that lifestyle to others living in poverty because they believe nobody deserves to live that way.

Some motivations may represent more narrow or circumstantial goals or character developmental ordeals. These types of motivations when completed are usually then replaced with another motivation, assuming that it doesn't end that character's heroic journey. For example: Your character could desire simply to find their missing parents. They desire a sense of family or at the very least closure, and will go through any ordeal to find them or what has happened to them.

A character's motivation may be changed at a later time to better reflect the experiences of a character or the conditions of their adventures. Motivations in this way are a freely controlled aspect of a character to be used as a tool to help direct your gameplay decisions.

### Traits

## Equipment

Items carried by a character are either equipped into one of your equipment slots or carried in your inventory's item slots. The collective weight of items is not tracked, but individually heavy items may be difficult to carry if your character is not very strong or athletic.

#### Item Slots

The default number of item slots available for characters to carry items is equal to that character's size. If characters want to carry more items, they must wear a bag. Bags allow characters to carry more items based on their passive strength and passive athletics up to the bag's *capacity limit*. For example: Satchels have a capacity limit of 8. If both your strength and athletics are a d6+1 (both with a passive value of 4), then the bag would provide 8 additional item slots. If your strength or athletics were any higher, then the bag would not provide any more slots because the limit of the bag has already been reached.

Some bags also provide a bonus number of slots in addition to their capacity limit. These bonus slots are not counted against the capacity limit. For example: Satchels also provide an a bonus +1 item slots. This makes them a valuable upgrade even if you have not reached their capacity limit.

All items at most occupy one item slot, but some items which are smaller can stack together into a single item slot. Items that can stack together into a single slot will be list their quantity in brackets after the item name. The price of those items accounts for the entire stack.

#### Starting Equipment

Each character starts with 100 currency to spend on items. Each coin or paper bill that represents your currency is a separate item, but up to 100 coins and bills can stack together into a single slot.

If you do not want to manually purchase your starting equipment, your archetype will list some recommended item loadouts which you may start with instead of the normal 100 currency.

#### Armour

?

#### Item Weight

All items and objects have a weight and your ability to carry or move that object is limited by your strength and athletics. Most things that exist will be light enough that keeping track of their weight is unnecessary. This means characters can carry a wide range of both heavy and light things as the collective weight of items does not need to be tracked. However, if a character is carrying a number of large or heavy objects beyond what is reasonable then the Game Master may decide it is not possible.

Characters have a *weight score* which is equal to their combined passive strength and passive athletics and have a *size multiplier* determined by their size (according to the table below), which combined are used to determine the heaviest objects they can carry. For example: A medium sized (5) character with a strength of d6+1 and an athletics of d4, would have a weight score of 6 and a size multiplier of 2.5.

<!-- Size Multiplier = (Size ^ 2) / 10 -->
##### Table: Size Multipliers
| Size | Size Name | Size<br/>Multiplier |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| 1 | Very Tiny | 0.1 |
| 2 | Tiny | 0.4 |
| 3 | Very Small | 0.9 |
| 4 | Small | 1.6 |
| 5 | Medium | 2.5 |
| 6 | Large | 3.6 |
| 7 | Very Large | 4.9 |
| 8 | Huge | 6.4 |
| 9 | Very Huge | 8.1 |
| 10 | Gigantic | 10 |
| 11 | Very Gigantic | 12.1 |
| 12 | Enormous | 14.4 |
| 13 | Very Enormous | 16.9 |
| 14 | Massive | 19.6 |
| 15 | Very Massive | 22.5 |
| 16 | Tremendous | 25.6 |
| 17 | Very Tremendous | 28.9 |
| 18 | Colossal |  32.4 |
| 19 | Very Colossal | 36.1 |
| 20 | Titanic | 40 |

The weight of the heaviest object you can lift in kilograms is equal to your weight score multiplied by your size multiplier multiplied by the highest roll you can make with an athletics skill check. For example: A medium sized (5) character with a strength of d6+1 and an athletics of d4, would be able to lift an object weighing 6 times 2.5 times 11 for a total of 165kg.

The lowest weight of an object you can lift in kilograms that requires an athletics check to lift is equal to your weight score multiplied by your size multiplier multiplied by the lowest roll plus 1 you can make with an athletics skill check. For example: A medium sized (5) character with a strength of d6+1 and an athletics of d4, would be able to lift objects weighing less than 6 times 2.5 times 3 for a total of 45kg without requiring an athletics check.

For objects with a weight anywhere in between your minimum and maximum ranges, simply divide the weight of the object by your weight score and size multiplier (rounded up) to find the difficulty value.
