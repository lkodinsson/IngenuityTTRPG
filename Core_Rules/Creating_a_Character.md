# Creating a Character

The process of creating a character is a series of small steps, with each step building a distinct part of your character. Generally the process starts with broad decisions and slowly builds to more finite decisions.

As a reminder, whenever you assign any stat or skill a roll value, it does not mean to roll those dice and assign it the resulting value. It means that you assign it the roll value itself. This represents what you roll when you use that stat or skill.

## Archetype and Background

Archetypes and backgrounds get you on the path to building a character with a strong theme, but they do not limit what your character can become. Essentially they are titles that provides you with some benefits and determine your starting skills and abilities. Archetypes are the strongest aspect of your character's theming as they represent where you are now as a character. In contrast, backgrounds describe who your character was in the past.
