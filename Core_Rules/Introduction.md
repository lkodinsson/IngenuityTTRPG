# Introduction

## The Basics

**MARS** features many similarities to other role-playing game systems. You will control a character that is defined by several abstract features. These features are called *stats*, *skills*, *talents*, and *traits*. Stats and skills are represented by dice, while talents and traits represent special abilities that a character can perform. As players progress they will be awarded experience points that they can spend to improve the stats and skills of their character, or to acquire new talents.

As a player you will interact inside a world controlled by a Game Master who determines certain properties about the world, such as the genre and setting. The genre of a world determines a lot of its core features like what types of abilities characters can use, what types of characters you will expect to play as and interact with, and what type of technology is present in that world.

## Rolling Dice

MARS uses standard [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) like most roleplaying games. Whenever you need to perform any game action that requires making a *roll* with your stats or skills you simply roll those dice and add them together to get the result.

### Passive Values

Any value that is represented by a die also has what is called a *passive value*. This value is always slightly below your average roll, making it a useful tool for estimating what you can expect to roll. It is calculated by simply dividing the maximum value of the dice in half, plus or minus any additional modifiers. For example: if you have a stat with a value of d6+1 then its passive value would be 3 plus 1 for a total of 4.

## Playing the Game

Typically in a game session the Game Master describes the scene, the players describe their actions, the Game Master describes the results of those actions, and then the game progresses to the next scene. Through the act of description and exposition, your characters and the world they inhabit become alive.

It is important to focus more on describing what it is your character does, rather than declaring the exact game action your character takes. It is more up to the Game Master to decide what actual game actions you perform, or what skill is required to overcome a challenge. This provides more freedom to narrate your character's intentions, rather than strictly adhering to gamified actions like a traditional board game. While describing what your character does, try not to detail the results of your character's actions, only the actions themselves. Dice may be rolled to determine the outcome of that action if the outcome is uncertain or failure carries potential consequence. The Game Master is otherwise responsible for deciding the results of your actions.

Often you will need to make numerical comparisons or add and subtract small values. If at any point during the game you are required to divide any numbers, the resulting number is always rounded down unless otherwise specified.

#### Archetypes, Backgrounds, and Ancestries

Each character is made out of various parts which define who that character is, what they do, what they know, and where they come from. Archetypes provide the bulk of what a character is capable of while their background and their ancestry primarily determine their history. Each of these properties come together to influence many of your character's stats which determine how well they can perform their various abilities.

#### Traits and Motivations

When you create a character you also get to design two unique properties of that character. Traits are abilities that only your character can perform, and motivations are the reason your character takes any actions at all. Together these features work to provide a unique play experience even if your character shares the same core building blocks as another character.

#### Adventures and Rewards

Each adventure that a character participates in is both prepared by and controlled by the Game Master. The goal of an adventure is to provide both risks and opportunities for characters to express themselves by rising to the challenges presented. In addition to the various material rewards like treasures and special items, acting according to your character's motivation also provides bonus experience both to you and another character. Experience points can then be spent to improve and acquire new abilities.

## Genres

There are many different worlds and environments that can be played in, worlds featuring one or more of: elves, wizards, dragons, robots, detectives, dinosaurs, cowboys, vikings, samurai, vampires, werewolves, aliens, racecars, superheroes, hackers, secret agents, and endless more. Content presented in **MARS** is categorized into *genres* which present these many different ideas into coherent groups. These genres are: *prehistoric*, *ancient*, *medieval*, *renaissance*, *industrial*, *post-industrial*, *space*, *historical*, *fantasy*, *steampunk*, *cyberpunk*, and *sci-fantasy*. These genres are often combined and some popular combinations include: *medieval fantasy*, *post-industrial cyberpunk*, *space sci-fantasy*, and *prehistoric steampunk*.

<!--Various parts of the game's content is technically categorized into these genres as listed in the [appendix](/Appendix/Genres). However, this is not a hard limitation and Game Masters are free to mix and match any of the game's content as they see fit.-->
