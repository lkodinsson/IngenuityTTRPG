# Character Features

## Stats

Stats are numerical and fundamental properties of a character, especially physical properties. Stats are split into two categories, *primary stats* and *secondary stats*. Respectively, these stats describe the broad and narrow features of a character.

### Primary Stats

Each character has four *primary stats* which are used to derive other stats and abilities. These stats are: *strength*, *dexterity*, *intelligence*, and *resolve*. All primary stats are represented by dice ranging from d4 to d12. Characters will start with dice values at either d4 or d6.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps
| Dice Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| d4 | Weak |
| d6 | Good |
| d8 | Great |
| d10 | Excellent |
| d12 | Superb |

All actions and most features of characters rely on primary stats. Typically this means rolling your primary stat (because it is represented by a die) when taking actions, but some other stats are determined mathematically from the value of your primary stat. Strength and dexterity are used for physical actions and features, while intelligence and resolve are typically used for mental actions and features. For example: your character uses their strength to interact with heavy objects, but your character's health is also determined by your strength.

### Secondary Stats

Each character has many additional stats which are derived from other sources such as your primary stats, abilities, or equipment. Some secondary stats act as resources, and managing these resources allows that character to survive difficult circumstances and perform exceptional abilities. All resource stats are represented by *current* and *maximum* values, where the current amount of that resource you can have is limited by its maximum, and may be spent until it runs out. *Health* and *endurance* are used to measure how well your character is surviving damage and physical stress, with endurance being easy to recover and health being difficult to recover. The other two resources are spent to perform special abilities, with *stamina* being used for physical abilities and *focus* being used for mental abilities.

When things happen to your character, your defensive stats are used to measure your character's response to those effects. *Fortitude* prepares your body for a physical challenge, *reflexes* prepare the body to move and react, and *willpower* prepares the mind to assess or mitigate influence. Against attacks you use your *deflection* and *damage resistance* which are affected by your armour.

When your character wants to interact with the world they have a few stats which describe them and their physical limits. This includes the *speed* that your character can move, their physical *size*, the number of items you can carry (as *item slots*), and your ability to carry heavy items (as a *weight score*).

## Archetypes and Backgrounds

*Archetypes*, often also called *classes*, are the core that a character is built from. Essentially they are a title that provides you with your initial set of abilities and provide context to the capabilities of a character. Although archetypes are responsible for what abilities you start with they are in no way a limitation on what your character can learn and become; there is no limit to the amount of change that a character can go through. For example: your character could start as a *fighter*, then later develop a deep understanding of magic and acquire the same abilities as a *wizard*.

*Backgrounds* function similarly to archetypes as they provide a title and a description, but they are more a reflection of a character's past than a character's present. In this way, the bonuses they provide to a character are much smaller, but they are still a meaningful part of that character's identity. 

Each character will have a single archetype and background that defines who they are.

## Ancestries

Where your character both comes from geographically and genetically are represented by their *ancestry*. This primarily determines your character's appearance and any natural abilities they have, including modifiers to their primary stats, size, and speed. Classic fantasy races like *orcs*, *elves*, and *dwarves* are all types of ancestries, but this can even extend to your lineage or heritage like if you were *british*, *danish*, or *japanese*.

## Skills

*Skills* represent practice in performing various groups of tasks and make certain types of actions easier for your character to perform. Like primary stats, skill values are represented by dice. All skills have associated primary stats that are rolled together with that skill whenever they are performed.

##### Table: Skill Steps
| Dice Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| d4 | Trained |
| d6 | Adept |
| d8 | Proficient |
| d10 | Expert |
| d12 | Master |

### Skill Checks

If you have taken an action and success is not guaranteed, then you will need to make a *skill check*. To do so, you will roll your skill and its assocaited primary stat together and compare your result to a *difficulty value* secretly determined by the Game Master. The result of this comparison will determine if you succeed at that task. For example: you attempt to leap over a large pit. This requires an *athletics check*. This requires you to roll both your *strength* and your *athletics*. If you have a strength of d8 and an athletics of d4, then you will roll them together (d8+d4) and compare that result to the secret difficulty value of that challenge.

All characters can use any skill even if they are not explicitly trained in that skill. If you do, then you will only roll that skill's associated stat, because untrained skills provide no dice value to roll. This means it is very difficult to succeed with any skills untrained, as the difference between being trained and untrained is a whole additional die to roll. For example: if in the previous example you were not trained in athletics, you would only roll your strength of a d8.

In other circumstances where two characters are making a comparison of the same skill, those characters will make what is called an *opposed check*. The results of an opposed check will result in one side succeeding and one side failing, with the exception of ties where neither side wins. For example: two characters want to compare physical ability and engage in an arm wrestling contest. They will both make athletics checks, with the character rolling the highest winning the arm wrestle.

#### Challenge Difficulty

Challenges exist at various difficulties represented by a name and a value. The names of these difficulties can be used as a rough metric for determining the difficulty of any challenge, most of which will exist within the *easy* to *challenging* difficulty range. Anything that is a difficulty of *ambitious* or harder is very rare. In order to succeed a skill check, the result of your roll must match or exceed the given difficulty value.

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty<br/>Value | Difficulty<br/>Name |
|:-:|:-|
| 3 | Easy |
| 6 | Moderate |
| 9 | Hard |
| 12 | Challenging |
| 15 | Ambitious |
| 18 | Absurd |
| 21 | Improbable |

Typically when characters interact with each other, one is rolling to set the difficulty value for the other. For example: One character tries to sneak around another character. One will be making an *agility check* to attempt to sneak, while the other will be making a *perception check* to notice the sneaky character. In this case, the character rolling their perception is setting the difficulty value for the sneaking character.

### Skill Duration

While most basic skills and actions can be performed in a matter of a couple seconds, some complex skills and actions cannot be performed so quickly. While it is expected that most complex actions that a character can take (as a result of skill checks) may take at least a few minutes, the exact duration is up to the Game Master based on the circumstances of the skill check. Some actions may even take several hours.

#### Failure

When a skill check is attempted and it does not result in a success, there are additional consequences for failure depending on the skill used. This can be getting caught when trying to be sneaky, breaking an object you're trying to tinker with, or otherwise making that task impossible. Usually once a task has been failed, it cannot be attempted again without considerable time in between attempts. This can include attempts made by other characters. However, characters can perform tasks together as a [group action](/Core_Rules/Encounters_and_Abilities#group-actions) to mitigate this drawback.

### The Luck Die

In addition to the dice you roll during a skill check, you will also roll a twenty-sided-die, called the *luck die*. If the result of your skill check is a success *and* the luck die has a value of 20 or greater, then that success becomes a *critical success* providing additional results determined by the context of the skill check. The luck die does not upgrade failures to successes in the same way unless you are at least proficient (d8) in that skill. Similarly, when you become a master (d12) in a skill, you also get a +1 bonus to your luck roll when using that skill.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Occasionally, circumstance, clever roleplaying, or the use of one of your abilities will provide you with *advantage*. For each source of advantage you have to a roll, you may reroll a die of your choice and keep the better result. *Disadvantage* works similarly to advantage, but instead of keeping the better result you must keep the worst result. The die that you reroll when you have disadvantage is the die with the greatest result. Advantage and disadvantage do not affect your luck die.

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, it would require an equal amount of disadvantage to entirely cancel out.

### Types of Skills

Skills fit into several categories, each one interacting primarily with different parts of the game. *General skills* affect most actions that your character takes in all parts of the game. *Combat skills*, *power skills*, and *spellcasting skills* all provide different special abilities depending on the skill and for more niche circumstances. *Languages* are also represented by a skill that a character has, but in most cases player characters will all have access to the same base language (called *Common* or *English*) to simplify player to player communication.

In the rules for each individual skill, they are each given a table detailing common tasks that you should expect along with that task's difficulty. Additionally, each skill is also broadly applicable to any other tasks not listed that fall within that skill's description. Some skills are very widely applicable like *athletics* and *agility* for nearly all physical tasks, *knowledge* for most mental tasks, and *charisma* for most social tasks. Other skills like *contacts* or *craft* have a much more narrow degree of application, yet can still be very useful.

#### General Skills

The majority of skills that exist are general skills, each one fulfilling a different niche. Each of the primary stats has their own grouping of three general skills that they work together with, except for strength which one has one: *athletics*. For dexterity, intelligence, and resolve, they have in order: *agility*, *perception*, and *sleight*, then *craft*, *knowledge*, and *medicine*, and finally *charisma*, *contacts*, and *taming*.

#### Combat Skills

Making attacks with a character requires the use of various combat skills: *archery*, *finesse*, *firearms*, *martial*, and *unarmed*. Making attacks with various weapons requires specialized training so each combat skill improves different categories of weapons, although some weapons are flexible enough that they can also be used with multiple different combat skills. Combat skills also provide characters with special abilities called *maneuvers* for each rank of that skill. Combat skills do not have associated stats, instead each weapon will have a listed associated stat while using it with that skill.

#### Power Skills

*Powers* are special abilites that allow you to perform supernatural feats beyond the normal physical limitations of your character: *metapowers*, *psionics*, and *superpowers*. These abilities are both acquired and performed similar to maneuvers like from combat skills. Power skills each have their own special rules and sub-specializations, making these types of skills the most complicated but also versatile skills available to characters.

##### Table: Power Tier Learning Limit
| Dice Value | Step Name | Highest Tier |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| d4 | Trained | 1 (Lesser) |
| d6 | Adept | 1 (Lesser) |
| d8 | Proficient | 2 (Greater) |
| d10 | Expert | 2 (Greater) |
| d12 | Master | 3 (Epic) |

#### Spellcasting Skills

Powers also come in another form called *spells* which are performed by spellcasting skills: *animism*, *faith*, *ki*, *sorcery*, and *wizardry*. Both spell powers and spellcasting skills function the same way as powers and power skills, including using the same abilities, but with one minor difference: the manifestation of these powers come from a magical source. Various powers and abilities may interact differently with each other depending on whether they are magical or non-magical. For example: an ability that can dispel magical effects will not work on effects that come from normal power skills, and will only interact with abilities that come from spell powers.

#### Languages

The languages that a character can speak are also represented as a type of skill. Normally, when your character speaks their native language you don't need to make any skills checks. However, whenever your character tries to use a language that they aren't native in, they will usually need to make a skill check with that language.

If any characters wish to learn new languages they will need to acquire them the same way that they would acquire other skills, and just like other skills non-native languages have dice values. Languages as skills are associated with intelligence. Once you become a master of that language, it is functionally the same as if you were native in that language, so you will no longer need to roll to determine success.

## Talents

Talents are acquired similar to skills, but rather than being represented by a roll value and used with an associated stat, talents are just a special ability. Their entire function is encompassed by what you can do with them or how they modify the overall function of your character. Archetypes which define the basis of a character's abilities will automatically provide one or two talents to new characters.

## Traits

Traits are special abilities unique to you, and are generally actions you can take or things that you possess. They provide opportunities to roleplay in a unique way and help make your character stand out from other similar characters. Traits can be mundane or supernatural, mechanical or descriptive, and they are a collaborative design decided by both you and your Game Master.
