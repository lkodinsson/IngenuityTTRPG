# Custom Ancestries

Rather than picking a predetermined ancestry to create a character with, ancestries can be custom made to represent a unique heritage or culture. Although ancestries are completely customizable, it is recommended to keep them similar to existing ancestries that are already similar in theme. The game master always has final say in what is reasonable or appropriate.

Ancestries have several properties including: *stat modifiers*, *size*, *abilities*, and *starting langauges*.

#### Stat Modifiers

Pick two stats to receive a +1 bonus.

#### Size

The default size that an ancestry provides is 5. This may be changed to any other size at no cost, but it is recommended that sizes remain between 3 and 7.

#### Abilities

Each ancestry gets 5 ancestry points to spend on [ancestry abilities](/Core/Ancestry_Abilities.md), with any unspent points going to waste after the creation process.

These abilities provide a large number of varying features that apply to all characters who share that ancestry. Most ancestry abilities are modifiers to stats, skills, or other features that mostly only work under special circumstances. Abilities that apply more consistent modifiers are usually more expensive. Some abilities also cost a negative amount of points which provide additional points to spend on other abilities.

#### Starting Languages

All characters start with the langauge common, allowing all player characters to understand each other. Additionally, custom ancestries may start with any additional language or a custom language belonging to their ancestry.

While some ancestries may have abilities that do not allow their characters to physically speak, having the language itself does allow them to read and write, and understand when others are speaking.
