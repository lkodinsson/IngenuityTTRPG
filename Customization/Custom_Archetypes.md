# Custom Archetypes

Archetypes are fundamentally a starting point for a character rather than a strict limitation of what the character can do and can be built manually by picking skills and talents. Each archetype gets five skills of any type, and one or two starting talents. This may be one talent that costs 8 experience or two talents that cost 4 experience each. If those talents require skills, then they must be of those chosen in the previous step. Archetypes typically have talents with simple or relaxed requirements but custom archetypes do not need to be as limited, so long as those requirements can be met during character creation.

If any of the chosen skills provide additional abilities like maneuvers and powers, then those are also chosen during character creation.

Finally, it is important to describe the archetype itself. The description should be short at only a few sentences and give guidance on what characters of that archetype have knowledge of, what actions they take, what their goals are, and in what circumstances they often find themselves in. 

#### Example Archetype - Weapon Master

While many fighters are dedicated to their overall role in warfare and are trained in a broad skillset, weapon masters dedicate themselves solely to their weapons. Weapon masters are trained in both the use and creation of all weapons, but receive little to no training in matters of medicine or diplomacy. The role of a weapon master is singular and without rival.
