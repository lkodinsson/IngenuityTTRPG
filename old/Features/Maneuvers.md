**Free action.** Make a perception test against the target's constitution. If you succeed, and for every 4 that you exceed the difficulty, choose one of the following: *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, *focus*, *constitution*, *evasion*, *willpower*, *physical deflection*, *elemental deflection*, *conditions*, and *weaknesses*. For each option that you pick, you will receive that information about the target.

---

#### Arrow Catch

**Skills:** Agility  
**Proficiencies:** Dodge  
**Cost:** 1 Stamina

**Reaction.** Dodge an attack against an incoming arrow, bolt, or thrown weapon. If successful, the item is caught and becomes held in the hand. Unlike the normal dodge action, you cannot choose to drop prone, seek cover, or move up to 1m.

---

#### Crippling Attack

**Skills:** Combat  
**Proficiencies:** Any combat proficiency
**Cost:** 2 Stamina

Make an attack. If it hits, compare it against the target's fortitude. If successful, they become crippled for the combat or scene, reducing their movement speed by half.

If this maneuver is performed as a reaction (such as by a readied action), then the target cannot move for the rest of their turn.

---

#### Crushing Strike

**Skills:** Combat  
**Proficiencies:** Martial, Unarmed  
**Cost:** 1 Stamina

Make a melee attack with a +1 bonus to damage. If the attack would not hit, get a bonus to the luck roll. This bonus is a +3 if the attack was made with bludgeoning weapon. Otherwise, it is only a +2.

**Proficiencies:** Convince, Persuade  
**Cost:** 1 Focus

Make a test against a target using *charisma* (for humanoids) or *taming* (for other animals) by insulting it logically (using *intelligence* and *convince*) or emotionally (using *resolve* and *persuade*). If the target cannot understand the insult, then the test is made with disadvantage. If it cannot hear the insult, then the test automatically fails.

The target takes typeless damage equal to the result of the test, which is reduced by the target's willpower. This damage *can* be reduced to zero and can only deal damage to the target's endurance. This damage cannot be blocked, evaded, or parried. The target may attempt a willpower defence test to reduce the damage if it would take any.

They may [brandish](/Appendix/Actions#brandish) the item during that turn to make it usable, but any actions taken with it are made with a -2 penalty. If the disarmed item is a shield, then it cannot be made usable with the brandish action like other items (they must wait until the end of their turn).

**Stamina Cost:** 1

#### Grapple

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Unarmed

**Action Type:** Two Actions  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

**Resist:** Reflexes (not grappled), Athletics, or Unarmed

Make an athletics or unarmed combat check against a target 1m away. Make this roll with advantage if you are behind the target. The target may resist with reflexes if not grappled. Otherwise, they may only resist with either athletics or unarmed.

Being in a grapple is essentially a tug of war, with each participant fightning for control of the grapple. If you succeed your grapple skill check, you start in control of the grapple. If you fail, the grapple starts in contention (a tie). Using the grapple maneuver is the primary way to wrestle for control while in a grapple. If you were already in a grapple, success brings you one step closer to control while failure results in no change.

While grappled, participants have their speed reduced to 1m, must move together, may optionally share the same space, and depending on their degree of control are also limited in the number of actions they can take. Only participants who are in control may [Brandish], [Disarm](#disarm), [Rise from Prone], or make attacks with weapons (unarmed attacks may still be made and even while holding a weapon). Weapons that are *large* or *two-handed* are too big to be used (even while in control). While not in control, all actions receive a -2 penalty to their rolls. While in contention, this penalty is reduced to a -1 instead.

As a free action a character who is in control may release themself (or another participant who is not in control) from the grapple. Otherwise, for a participant who is being controlled or in contention to escape they must perform the grapple maneuver as normal but changing the effect of a success from gaining a degree of control to releasing themself from the grapple.

Attacks from non-grappled characters against grappled targets are made with advantage as if they are considered flanked.

---

#### Hard Parry

**Type:** Defensive  
**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial

**Action Type:** Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

While wielding a weapon that can deal slashing damage, instead of using deflection to defend against an incoming attack, roll just your combat skill (and not its associated stat) adding your armour rating as a bonus. If using a weapon that has the parry feature, roll that as well. This counts as a skill check (and includes rolling the luck die).

<!--In addition to replacing your deflection roll, also roll the luck die. If the luck roll is successful, then the incoming attack misses completely. If both you and your attacker succeed on your luck dice, the effects of both dice are negated.-->

---

#### Heavy Strike

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Martial, Unarmed

**Action Type:** One Action  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

Make an attack with a +2 damage bonus but with a -1 attack penalty.

You may spend an additional 1 stamina to increase the bonus to +3, but the penalty is also increased to -2.

---

#### Hook Parry

**Type:** Defensive  
**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial

**Action Type:** Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

While wielding an axe or hooked object, give an incoming melee attack disadvantage. Also roll the luck die. If the luck roll is successful, then the incoming attack misses completely. If both you and your attacker succeed on your luck dice, the effects of both dice are negated.

---

#### Intercept

**Type:** Defensive  
**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial, Unarmed

**Action Type:** Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

Trade places with an adjacent ally (within 1m), become the new attack target, and get a +1 bonus to armour rating and damage reduction against the attack. You may also block or parry the attack for free as a part of this action.

Before intercepting you may spend 1 stamina to move next to an ally as a part of this reaction.<!--You may take a move action as a part of this reaction before intercepting the incoming attack.--> If you do, you get one less action during your next turn. This cannot be done if you are stunned.

---

#### Intercepting Strike

**Type:** Defensive  
**Specializations:** Any

**Action Type:** Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

**Resist:** Fortitude

Make an attack with a +2 attack bonus against a target who is attacking an ally. This attack occurs before the target's attack. If the attack hits, their current attack is negated and they get a -2 penalty to all rolls that target that ally this turn.

---

#### Intimidating Strike

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Martial, Unarmed

**Action Type:** Two Actions  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

**Resist:** Willpower

Make a charisma check against a target within melee range. If successful, the target gets a -2 penalty to all rolls that target your allies for one round. Then, regardless of success, make a melee attack against that target. If your charisma check was successful, the attack gets a +2 attack bonus. Otherwise, it gets a +1 bonus.

---

#### Knock Down

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Archery, Martial, Unarmed

**Action Type:** Two Actions  
**Stamina Cost:** 2

**Resist:** Fortitude

Make an attack with a -1 damage penalty. If the attack hits, the target becomes prone.

---

#### Leap Strike

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial, Unarmed

**Action Type:** Two Actions  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

This maneuver can be used to do one of the following: leap over an obstacle in between you and a target; or leap a distance between you and your target. Either option is then followed by an attack against that target.

If you choose to leap over an obstacle, it must be directly in front of you and with a width in meters less than or equal to half of your speed (rounded down). To do so, make an agility check against a difficulty equal to triple its width. If successful, leap to the other side of that obstacle, then make an attack with a +2 attack bonus against your target. Otherwise, do not move to the other side of the obstacle, and do not make an attack against the target. Failure may result in you landing on top of the obstacle instead of over it.

If you choose to leap over a distance, there must be at least 1m of empty space in front of you (to perform a running start) and the way must be unblocked. You will start by moving 1m forward, then make an athletics check against a difficulty determined by the distance remaining to leap over. The difficulty is equal to triple the distance in meters. If successful, leap across the distance, then make an attack with a +2 attack bonus against your target. Otherwise, leap a distance equal to a third of your roll (rounded down), and do not make an attack against the target.

This maneuver cannot be performed if your speed is less than 2m. The greatest distance you can leap is equal to your speed.

---

#### Opportunity Strike

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial, Unarmed

**Action Type:** Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

**Resist:** Fortitude

Make a melee attack against a target moving through your attack range. This maneuver can only be used if the target is moving a distance greater than 1m through your attack range, but not if that movement is from an evade action or a defensive maneuver. If the attack hits, their movement is stopped at the earliest point that they moved through your attack range (they may still take more move actions).

This maneuver cannot be used while prone.

---

#### Penetrating Strike

**Type:** Offensive

---

#### Poisonous Strike

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Archery, Finesse

**Action Type:** Two Actions  
**Stamina Cost:** 2

Make an attack with a weapon. If the attack hits, make a medicine check against a difficulty of 6 to inflict [Poison](/Appendix/Conditions#poison) 3 upon the target or Poison 2 if you fail the check, with medicine check determining the difficult of the poison, and with a trigger duration of one turn. This causes it to quickly lose health over a short period of time.

This maneuver may also be performed to pre-apply a single use poison to a weapon that inflicts the same effect the first time it hits. In this case, make the medicine check while pre-applying the poison.

Performing this maneuver can only be done by spending a pre-made poison or materials that can be used to approximate a poison.

<!--

poison strengths 2~5, difficulty = (strength - 1) * 3
I guess poisons should be expensive?
