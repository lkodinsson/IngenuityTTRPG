#### Automaton

Automatons are quite rare, as they are not naturally occuring creatures. They are typically constructed by exceptional artificers and are usually found in their accompaniment, if not found lost and abandoned. They require regular maintenance and if found are usually capable of repairing themselves if not accompanied by an artificer.

**Attributes** Automatons get a +1 bonus to any two attributes.

**Construct** The automaton's body is constructed of various artificial materials and does not perform normal biological functions. They are immune to being sick (like poison and disease), are no longer required to eat, drink, or sleep, but instead require at least 7 hours of full sunlight every week to remain powered. They may enter a low powered state to extend that duration to 7 years, but cannot take any actions except powering back up during this time. If they completely lose power or choose to power down completely, they cannot awaken unless brought to full charge or another creature activates them. Additionally, any lightning damage taken instead acts like an equivalent number of hours charging in sunlight. Any lightning damage taken in excess of a full charge is treated as normal.

The automaton does not recover 1 health after a rest. Instead they may be repaired during a rest using the craft skill the same way a normal creature would using the medicine skill. Additionally, if they would be repaired by a special ability (like the [Mend](/Features/Powers#mend) power) they also recover an additional 1 health.

The automaton also gets natural armour as a part of its body, which can be modified like any other armour, or replaced by any other metal armour type. This natural armour only applies its armour rating and damage reduction if they are greater than any body armour that they are also wearing. By default the natural armour provides 2 armour rating and 3 damage resistance. This armour is treated as having a cost of 50 for the purposes of crafting upgrades onto it. This armour considered to be a part of its body and is not considered to be worn.

**Hunter Vision** Over a period of about a minute, the creature can adapt its vision to either that of infrared vision or low-light vision.

**Size** Automatons are typically medium sized (5).

#### Dwarf

Dwarves tend to live in isolated communities deep within caves and mountains keeping many of their secrets to themselves. They are known for their strength, unique runic magics, and inventive craftsdwarfship. Dwarves found outside of their isolate communits are either keeping their secrets closely guarded or are so far removed from the other communities that they could not possible know anything anyway.

**Attributes** Dwarves get +1 Strength and +1 Resolve.

**Iron Gut** Dwarves get a +1 bonus to fortitude to resist any effects that would make them sick (such as poison, disease, or drinking alcohol).

**Grit** Dwarves get a +1 bonus to maximum health, endurance, stamina, and focus.

**Slow** Dwarves get a -1 penalty to their speed.

**Stability** Dwarves get a +1 bonus to fortitude to resist any effects that would knock them back or knock them prone.

**Weightlifter** Dwarves have a weight score as though they were one size larger and get a +1 bonus to item slots.

**Size** Dwarves are medium sized (5), but are as short as a small sized creature and weigh as much as a large sized creature.

#### Elf

Elves are proud noble creatures with exceptionally long life spans who are fond of nature. They are not well known for living in communities amongst other types of creatures, but it does happen. Although they are very similar to humans, there is an air of magic and beauty about them that is unmistakeable. Because elves age very slowly they often find it easier to convince others with logic as it is difficult to argue with someone who has the potential to be several lifespans older.

**Attributes** Elves get +1 Dexterity and +1 Intelligence.

**Adaptation** Elves get a +1 bonus to knowledge, but at the cost of a -1 penalty to charisma.

**Irrefutable Logic** Elves may use their intelligence instead of their resolve when making charisma checks to convince someone of something.

**Niche** Elves get a +1 bonus to perception only while in a natural environment.

**Size** Elves are medium sized (5), but can be as tall as a large sized creature.

#### Human

Humans are known for their ability to adapt to any circumstance, typically working together to create large societies and monuments. The most notable humans are usually individuals that impose rule, or those that act outside of societies living as hermits or heroes. Humanity is best described by its versatility and diversity. While they are community driven creatures, humans are often at the forefront of exploration and exploitation.

**Attributes** Humans get a +1 bonus to any two attributes.

**Generalist** Whenever humans acquire a new skill or talent it costs 1 less experience.

**Grit** Humans get a +1 bonus to maximum health, endurance, stamina, and focus.

**Versatility** Humans get a +1 bonus to any one skill not provided by their background.

**Size** Humans are medium sized (5).

#### Lizardfolk

Typically found dwelling in dark and damp environments, they do not often interact with many other humanoid species. While their environment does play a major role in their seclusion, they often choose not to seek out interaction. Lizardfolk live for extended periods of time and can recover quickly from injuries, which provides their civilizations with a greater concentration of surviving elders. As a result lizardfolk find a greater comfort in the wisdom of their own elders than seeking insight from other races. As a result of their lack of communication this often leaves them technologically behind other societies.

**Attributes** Lizardfolk get +1 Dexterity and +1 Resolve.

**Dark Vision** Lizardfolk can see in both areas devoid of light and poorly lit areas with ease, but have difficulty seeing in broad daylight.

**Natural Weapons** Lizardfolk have two natural weapons:

* *Bite*: STR/DEX Unarmed for 4 P, Crit 20/+4, Momentum, Swift
* *Tail*: STR/DEX Unarmed for 4 B/S, Crit 20/+4, Nonlethal, Trip

**Niche** Lizardfolk get a +1 bonus to medicine while in a cave or a body of water.

**Regeneration** After taking a rest, Lizardfolk recover 1 additional health.

**Slow** Lizardfolk get a -1 penalty to their speed.

**Size** Lizardfolk are typically medium or large sized (5 or 6).

#### Lupine

Lupines are humanoid wolves with hardy, imposing builds. They live in tight-knit family groups with some young adults choosing to leave after coming of age. They have keen senses and a close connection with nature, feeling most comfortable with soil beneath their paws. The powerful lupines never shy away from combat, which their culture views as a deeply spiritual endeavour.

**Attributes** Lupines get +1 Strength and +1 Resolve.

**Fast** Lupines get a +1 bonus to their speed.

**Low-light Vision** Lupines can see in both daylight and poorly lit areas with ease.

**Natural Weapons** Lizardfolk have two natural weapons:

* *Claws*: STR/DEX Unarmed for 3 P/S, Crit 19/+6, Cleave, Swift
* *Tail*: STR/DEX Unarmed for 4 B/S, Crit 20/+4, Nonlethal, Trip

**Niche** Lupines gets a +1 bonus to perception checks using smell to detect other creatures.

**Size** Lupines are typically medium or large sized (5 or 6).

#### Mycelian

Mycelians are mobile fungus folk roughly in the shape of humanoids. The bodies of individual mycelians can vary wildly but always follow a basic layout of two arms and two legs. They do not have mouths, rendering them entirely incapable of verbal communication. Among themselves mycelians communicate mentally with one another, and some individuals also learn sign language to more easily converse with other races. Ancient elder mycelians can be much larger than normal mycelians, but are rooted in the ground and unable to move. These ancient elder mycelians are the progenitors of other mycelians.

**Attributes** Mycelians get +1 Intelligence and +1 Resolve.

**Adaptation** Mycelians get a +1 bonus to medicine, but at the cost of a -1 penalty to agility.

**Fungal Body** Mycelians have no mouth and cannot speak normally, but can speak mentally to any living creature they are directly touching as long as the recipient is willing. This communication does not require that both creatures speak the same language but some may find it intrusive. The sporecap on their head prevents them from wearing any kind of headgear, but they can emit spores to identify the position of nearby creatures regardless of lighting conditions. These spores also allow them to communicate with each other without directly touching.

**Grit** Mycelians get a +1 bonus to maximum endurance, stamina, and focus.

**Size** Mycelians can be anywhere from very small to very large sized (3 to 7).

#### Orc

Known for their imposing demeanor, orcs they are often mistakenly labelled as brutes. While they are naturally physically capable, they are just as varied and diverse as anyone else. Although they are not brutes, this misconception can be used in their favour to more easily manipulate those who do not know any better.

**Attributes** Orcs get +1 Strength and +1 Resolve.

**Headstrong** Orcs get a +1 bonus to charisma checks to intimdate other creatures and a +1 bonus to willpower to resist being influenced in the same way.

**Grit** Orcs get a +1 bonus to maximum endurance, stamina, and focus.

**Pain Tolerance** The first time during an encounter that Orcs are reduced to zero endurance by damage, any excess damage is reduced to zero (none of that damage is taken to health). Additionally, they get advantage to luck rolls made to stabilize while unconscious and may choose to not become unconscious when given the dying effect. While dying, they still lose health each turn, make luck rolls to stabilize, and at any point may choose to become unconscious.

**Size** Orcs are typically medium or large sized (5 or 6).

---

#### Sagafolk

Visually sagafolk are similar to humans but of a smaller size. Sagafolk mostly keep to their own communities and care more for food, drink, and entertainment than the dramatic affairs of others. Even so, they are not shy to gossip about strangers passing through their parts of the world. To them, anything can be made into a good story, even rumors about what would be nothing at all.

**Attributes** Sagafolk get +1 Dexterity and +1 Resolve.

**Brave** Sagafolk get a +1 bonus to willpower to resist any effects that would cause them fear.

**Grit** Sagafolk get a +1 bonus to maximum health, endurance, stamina, and focus.

---

#### Vulpine

Vulpines are agile and clever creatures resembling humanoid foxes. They tend to live in small tribes amongst their own kind (some of which are nomadic), with older generations often keeping a distance from others. Because they are quite rare they are often seen as a curiosity as core aspects of their cultures are not well known.

**Attributes** Vulpines get +1 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence, and -1 Strength.

**Graceful** Vulpines get a +1 bonus to agility and athletics checks when leaping, running, climbing, or evading.

**Low-light Vision** Vulpines can see in both daylight and poorly lit areas with ease.
