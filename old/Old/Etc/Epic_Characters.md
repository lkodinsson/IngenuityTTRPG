# Epic Characters

The upper limit of power that characters can achieve is high enough to overcome many but not all difficulty challenge ratings with consistency. In this way, certain challenges can remain significantly difficult yet technically achievable by utilizing circumstancial bonuses and advantages. If you're looking for gameplay that has characters pushing beyond this limit and achieving the impossible, then this power level can be explored with epic characters. This is useful for adventures where you want characters to act more like demigods or superheroes.

Epic characters receive what is called the epic die which is added to all skill checks. It advances similar to stats and skills, but with a greater cost.

##### Table: Epic Die Steps & Cost
