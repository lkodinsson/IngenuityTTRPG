# Custom Archetypes

Archetypes are a framework and that helps differentiate characters and provides them with some abilities. There are not a strict limitation but rather a starting point for a character concept.

The first step is in describing the archetype. This description should be only a few sentences long and give guidance to characters of that archetype. What actions do they take? What are their goals? In what circumstances do they often find themselves?

The second step is in assigning them all of their stats and abilities. Each archetype has an attribute that is important to them and most of the actions that a character of that archetype will take. Pick one or two attributes to recommend at a value of d6. From here we need to know what skillset that archetype uses. Each archetype provides five skills and four proficiencies. Sometimes archetypes will list multiple choices a character can make of multiple profiencies but this is not required. Each archetype gets one of the three talents of either Longevity (+4), Mindfulnees (+4), or Toughness (+4). Additionally, each archetype gets one of any talent that has an experience cost of 4. Finally, each archetype gets to start with two learned abilities divided among maneuvers and/or powers. These abilities should signal what situations or type of actions that archetype prioritizes. 

The third step is in recommending equipment that a typical character of this archetype would carry. If that archetype has any skills or proficiencies that rely on tools, make sure to provide those items in the recommended equipment. The total cost of all the equipment should ideally be pretty low but capping at 100 currency, and at most around 8 to 10 items.

#### Example Archetype - Weapon Master

While many fighters are dedicated to their overall role in warfare and are trained in a broad skillset, weapon masters dedicate themselves solely to their weapons. Weapon masters are trained in both the use and creation of weapons and receive little to no training in matters of medicine or diplomacy. The role of a weapon master is singular and without rival.
