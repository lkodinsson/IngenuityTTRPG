## Weapons

Weapons have many characteristics, some of which each weapon shares: *associated attribute*, *damage*, *damage type*, *critical threshold*, *critical damage*, *associated skills*, and *weight*. The combination of associated stats and skills are what is allowed to be used when making combat skill checks to attack with the given weapon. Each weapon deals one or more types of physical damage noted as single letters: *B*, *P*, and *S*, for *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. Typically the type of damage dealt is not functionally different, but may limit situational use of the weapon.
