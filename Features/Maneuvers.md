**Action Type:** Two Actions  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

**Resist:** Reflexes (not grappled), Athletics, or Unarmed

Make an athletics or unarmed combat check against a target 1m away. Make this roll with advantage if you are behind the target. The target may resist with reflexes if not grappled. Otherwise, they may only resist with either athletics or unarmed.

If the roll is a graze or better and you are not already grappled, become grappled with the target. Then, if the roll was a success or better, you may choose to either gain control of the grapple or have the target lose control of the grapple. If the roll was a failure, the target chooses instead. By default, both participants start grappled without control, and may share the same degree of control (both participants can be without control or in control at the same time). Taking the grapple actions while in a grapple is the primary way to wrestle for control.

While grappled, participants have their speed reduced to 1m, may optionally share the same space, and can only perform a limited selection of maneuvers and basic actions. As usual, any maneuvers not learned may still be [improvised](/Core_Rules/Encounters_and_Abilities.md#improvising-maneuvers) by participants.

All participants can only perform the following actions and maneuvers: [*attack*](/Appendix/Actions.md#attack), [*grapple*](#grapple), [*push*](#push), and [*trip*](#trip). Participants who are in control may also: [*brandish*](/Appendix/Actions.md#brandish), [*concussive strike*](#concussive-strike), [*crushing strike*](#crushing-strike), [*disarm*](#disarm), [*heavy strike*](#heavy-strike), [*knock down*](#knock-down), [*move*](/Appendix/Actions.md#move), [*penetrating strike*](#penetrating-strike), [*precise strike*](#precise-strike), [*rise from prone*](/Appendix/Actions.md#rise-from-prone), and [*wild strike*](#wild-strike). Additionally, as a free action a character who is in control may release another participant who is not in control from the grapple.

Participants in a grapple all move together.

Only those who are are in control may attack with non-unarmed weapons. Unarmed attacks may be made even while holding a weapon. Weapons with the *large* or *two-handed* features are too big to be used, even while in control, but weapons with the *versatile* feature can still be used while in control. Attacks made by participants who do not have control are always downgraded to a graze if they would result in a success or better.

Attacks from non-grappled characters against grappled targets are made with advantage as if they are always considered flanked.
