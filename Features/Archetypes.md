#### Artificer

Artificers are gifted craftspersons that are capable of inventing all kinds of devices with the assistance of magic. Some of these devices they use themselves, but some artificers prefer to craft solely to witness others benefit from their inventions.

**Skills** [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res)/[Knowledge](/Features/Skills#knowledge-int), [Craft](/Features/Skills#craft-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Sleight](/Features/Skills#sleight-dex), [Wizardry (Enchantment/Transmutation)](/Features/Skills#wizardry)  
**Abilities** Artificers start with one wizardry spell power and the ability to improvise wizardry spell powers.  
**Talent** [Arcane Synthesis (Rank 1)](/Features/Talents#arcane-synthesis).  
**Primary Stat** Artificers must start with a maximum intelligence of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** Optionally one of an engineering, fletching, jeweling, smithing, trapmaking or woodworking toolkit; a spellbook and writing toolkit; an alchemy toolkit with some alchemical bases; a latchet crossbow with twenty bolts; padded armour; and some rough gemstones.

---

#### Assassin

Rogues may have a bad reputation in some circles, but that's mostly the fault of assassins. It's not entirely without reason, however, as both assassins and rogues prefer to slink in the shadows. Assassins excel primarily at inflicting death. While this is true, they owe it to their medicinal knowledge. This type of knowledge allows them to prepare both poisons and antidotes.

<!--Not to be confused with Hitmen, who specialize in firearms (sniper rifles) to kill people.-->

**Skills** [Agility](/Features/Skills#agility-dex), [Finesse](/Features/Skills#finesse), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Sleight](/Features/Skills#sleight-dex)  
**Abilities** Assassins start with one finesse maneuver.  
**Talent** [Ambidexterity (+1)](/Features/Talents#ambidexterity).  
**Primary Stat** Assassins must start with a maximum dexterity of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A thrusting dagger and a parrying dagger; a grappling hook and rope (20m); a latchet crossbow with twenty bolts; a lock picking toolkit; a medicine toolkit; a mask; and padded or leather armour.

---

#### Bard

Bards, much like wizards, are educated and personable. Bards use cleverness and a sharp tongue to overcome challenges. Given the more well-rounded education that a bard possesses, they might be considered a jack-of-all-trades. They are often a reasonable substitute when a specialist is unavailable.

**Skills** [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res), [Finesse](/Features/Skills#finesse), [Knowledge](/Features/Skills#knowledge-int), [Sleight](/Features/Skills#sleight-dex), [Wizardry](/Features/Skills#wizardry-int)  
**Abilities** Bards start with one finesse maneuver and one wizardry spell power.  
**Talent** [Inspirational Charisma](/Features/Talents#inspirational-charisma).  
**Primary Stat** Bards must start with a maximum resolve of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A dueling sword; a small buckler; a spellbook and writing toolkit; fancy clothes; and a musical instrument.

---

#### Berserker

While fighters might choose diplomacy, or champions might seek to protect their allies, berserkers live for combat above all else. Berserkers can harness the power of pure rage in combat to deliver powerful blows and shrug off pain. Typically, those who might call themselves berserkers are those from more tribal and militaristic societies, or those who engage in the sport of fighting others like gladiators.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Charsima](/Features/Skills#charisma), [Martial](/Features/Skills#martial), [Taming](/Features/Skills#taming-res), [Unarmed](/Features/Skills#unarmed)  
**Abilities** Berserkers start with one martial maneuver and one unarmed maneuver.  
**Talent** [Rage (+1)](/Features/Talents#rage).  
**Primary Stat** Berserkers must start with a maximum strength and a maximum resolve of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A large, two-handed, or versatile weapon; a leather or small shield; greaves; a half helm; and plated bracers.

---

#### Champion

While clerics can represent the full spectrum of the devoted, champions represent the militaristic strong arm of these ideologies. They are there to protect those they declare in need, primarly those who follow tenets resembling their own. They are often drafted as mercenaries to empires who show loyalty to their cause.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res), [Faith (Militarist)](/Features/Skills#faith-res), [Martial](/Features/Skills#martial), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int)  
**Abilities** Chapmions start with one martial maneuver, one faith spell power, and one bonus faith spell power (determined by their specialization).  
**Talent** [Divine Axiom](/Features/Talents#divine-axiom).  
**Primary Stat** Champions must start with a maximum resolve of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A cooking or medicine toolkit; a mace or warhammer; a small or medium shield; and leather, segmented, chainmail armour.

---

#### Cleric

Many people have a code they follow that defines who they are, but clerics make it a part of their life's work. Clerics are often guides and teachers. Despite the work put into their faith and those involved, they typically do not create their own following. They are more likely to gather a following in the name of whatever divine entity they believe in, rather than for themselves.

**Skills** [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res), [Faith](/Features/Skills#faith-res), [Knowledge](/Features/Skills#knowledge-int), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex)  
**Abilities** Clerics start with one faith spell power and one bonus faith spell power (determined by their specialization).
**Talent** [Divine Devotion (1/rest)](/Features/Talents#divine-devotion).  
**Primary Stat** Clerics must start with a maximum resolve of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A cooking or medicine toolkit; a lantern with oil (36 hours); and an iron necklace symbolizing their deity.

---

#### Druid

Druids are magic users that are in tune with the forces of nature. Druids are rare to meet as they are typically ascetics who abstain from civilization. While many of them do live in the wild, often disguised as animals, some of them do occasionally interact with other people. Sometimes this is just to maintain some form of diplomatic position, or to dissuade others from encroaching on nature.

**Skills** [Agility](/Features/Skills#agility-dex)/[Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Animism](/Features/Skills#animism-res), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Taming](/Features/Skills#taming-res)  
**Abilities** Druids start with one animism spell power and one bonus animism spell power: [Speak with Animals](/Features/Powers#speak-with-animals).  
**Talent** [Wild Aspect](/Features/Talents#wild-aspect).  
**Primary Stat** Druids must start with a maximum resolve of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A medicine toolkit; a handaxe or knife; a staff; bone or slatted armour; and an extra waterskin.

---

#### Fighter

Whether it is for honor, glory, revenge, or to defend the weak, fighters are skilled in the arts of combat and warfare. Through the use of various combat maneuvers, fighters are vital to winning various conflicts of physical prowess. Although fighters are primarily combatants, they are also often skilled in the application of medicine and diplomacy.

**Skills** [Archery](/Features/Skills#archery)/[Finesse](/Features/Skills#finesse)/[Martial](/Features/Skills#martial), [Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex)  
**Abilities** Fighters start with two maneuvers.  
**Talent** [Extra Maneuver](/Features/Talents#extra-maneuver), and [Toughness (+4)](/Features/Talents#toughness).  
**Primary Stat** Fighters must start with either a maximum strength or maximum dexterity of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A cooking, medicine, or smithing toolkit; one, two, or three weapons; a small or medium shield; leather, segmented, or chainmail armour; and an extra waterskin full of ale.

---

#### Magister

The might of the magister sits deep within their mind, for above all else a magister is educated. Magisters dedicate themselves to preparing for both the known and unknown. If there is a task that someone else cannot complete, the magister is likely to be capable of finding or creating the solution.

**Skills** [Craft](/Features/Skills#craft-int), [Knowledge](/Features/Skills#knowledge-int), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Sleight](/Features/Skills#sleight-dex)  
**Talent** [Always Prepared (1/rest)](/Features/Talents#always-prepared).  
**Primary Stat** Magisters must start with a maximum intelligence of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** At least one of an alchemy, engineering, or medicine toolkit; a book and a writing toolkit; a lantern with oil (36 hours); a knife; one or more pieces of jewelry; and a bottle of wine.

---

#### Monk

Body, mind, and spirit are the domains of monks. Through meditation and constant martial discipline, monks are capable of asserting forces beyond what one might believe possible. The way of the monk is more about mastery of one's-self rather than mastery over others. This does not mean that monks are pacifists, however, as they will often defend themselves if given good reason.

**Skills** [Agility](/Features/Skills#agility-dex)/[Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Ki](/Features/Skills#ki), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Unarmed](/Features/Skills#unarmed)  
**Abilities** Monks start with one maneuver and one ki spell power.  
**Talent** [Longevity (+2)](/Features/Talents#longevity), and [Mindfulness (+2)](/Features/Talents#mindfulness).  
**Primary Stat** Monks may start with any stats.

**Recommended Equipment** A staff or warstaff; two hand wraps; padded armour; and a copper necklace with several rough gemstones beaded on it.

---

#### Ranger

Some people prefer to live among nature, where insight is a key component to survival and understanding. Survival in nature requires a keen eye and a sharp mind; those who call themselves rangers have a strong ability to solve puzzles or understand complicated mysteries and a personal association with nature. Rangers are often found acting as guardians or managers of a natural wildlife habitat.

**Skills** [Agility](/Features/Skills#agility-dex)/[Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Archery](/Features/Skills#archery)/[Finesse](/Features/Skills#finesse), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Taming](/Features/Skills#taming-res)  
**Abilities** Rangers start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Deduction](/Features/Talents#deduction), and [Toughness (+4)](/Features/Talents#toughness).

**Recommended Equipment** At least one of a fletching or trapmaking toolkit; a medicine toolkit; a longsword or a longbow with twenty arrows; a handaxe or knife; padded or leather armour; and an extra waterskin.

---

#### Rogue

The world is full of dangers and unknowns. Rogues live and breathe in the world of peril, prepared to fight back with sharp wits or sharp blades. They are particularly known for their ability to tamper with various devices, such as traps and locks. It is likely that they are great thieves and smugglers, but it might not be safe to say it to their faces.

**Skills** [Agility](/Features/Skills#agility-dex), [Archery](/Features/Skills#archery)/[Finesse](/Features/Skills#finesse), [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res), [Sleight](/Features/Skills#sleight-dex), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex)  
**Abilities** Rogues start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Danger Sense (Rank 1)](/Features/Talents#danger-sense).  
**Primary Stat** Rogues must start with a maximum dexterity of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** Locking picking and trapmaking toolkits; a grappling hook and rope (20m); a small silvered mirror; a straight sword or a shortbow with twenty arrows; a dagger or several knives; a mask; and padded or leather armour.

---

#### Sorcerer

Sorcerers are like wizards in that they are known for their magic, but it is not a power they have learned from study. This ability to cast spells is innate and a major part of their personality. As a result, sorcerers are often outgoing and are highly sociable, even with animals.

**Skills** [Agility](/Features/Skills#agility-dex)/[Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res), [Contacts](/Features/Skills#contacts-res), [Sorcery](/Features/Skills#sorcery-res), [Taming](/Features/Skills#taming-res)  
**Abilities** Sorcerers start with one sorcery spell power.  
**Talent** [Esoteric Will](/Features/Talents#esoteric-will).  
**Primary Stat** Sorcerers must start with a maximum resolve of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A knife or staff; padded armour; and one or more pieces of jewelry.

---

#### Theurge

Theurges are powerful spellcasters dedicated to the pursuit of occult mastery. In addition to educating themselves on how to cast spells, they will also devote themselves to a higher power to acquire more spellcasting ability. Theurges believe they are more powerful than other spellcasters, but due to their higher rate of seclusion in the pursuit of eldritch knowledge, they are also typically lesser known.

**Skills** [Faith](/Features/Skills#faith-res), [Knowledge](/Features/Skills#knowledge-int), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Wizardry](/Features/Skills#wizardry-int)  
**Abilities** Theurges start with one wizardry spell power, one faith spell power, one bonus faith spell power (determined by their specialization), and the ability to improvise wizardry spell powers.  
**Talent** [Metapowers](/Features/Talents#metapowers).  
**Primary Stat** Theurges must start with a maximum intelligence or maximum resolve of 7 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A medicine toolkit; a spellbook and writing toolkit; a lantern with oil (36 hours); a staff; padded armour; one or more pieces of jewelry; and some rough gemstones.

---

#### Warmage

Where fighters might represent more varied martial roles, warmages are trained more specifically for war. Empires prefer to employ warmages due to their affiliation with the military, rather than wizards who are more likely to seek their own interests. While warmages lack the diplomatic tact of their fighter counterparts, they are still capable of administering general medicine.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Features/Skills#athletics-str), [Finesse](/Features/Skills#finesse)/[Martial](/Features/Skills#martial), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Wizardry (Enchantment/Transmutation)](/Features/Skills#wizardry-int)  
**Abilities** Warmages start with one manever, one wizardry spell power, and the ability to improvise wizardry spell powers.  
**Talent** [Spell Combat](/Features/Talents#spell-combat).  
**Primary Stat** Warmages must start with a maximum intelligence of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment**  A cooking, medicine, or smithing toolkit; a spellbook and writing toolkit; one, two, or three weapons; a small or medium shield; leather, segmented, or chainmail armour; some rough gemstones; and an extra waterskin full of ale.

---

#### Wizard

When it comes to both acts of magery and knowledge of ancient secrets, wizards stand at the forefront. Similar to clerics, wizards are often guides and teachers; they are known because of their relationships with others. Wizards are often sought out by both adventurers and normal folk alike to help them find solutions to their problems. Even if magic isn't the required answer, the wizard might still have access to useful knowledge.

**Skills** [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisam-res), [Knowledge](/Features/Skills#knowledge-int), [Medicine](/Features/Skills#medicine-int), [Perception](/Features/Skills#perception-dex), [Wizardry](/Features/Skills#wizardry-int)  
**Abilities**  Wizards start with one wizardry spell power and the ability to improvise wizardry spell powers.  
**Talent** [Spell Preparation](/Features/Talents#spell-preparation).  
**Primary Stat** Wizards must start with a maximum intelligence of 5 or greater.

**Recommended Equipment** A medicine toolkit; a spellbook and writing toolkit; a lantern with oil (36 hours); a staff; padded armour; one or more pieces of jewelry; and some rough gemstones.
