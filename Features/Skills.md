#### Charisma (RES)

The capacity to convince others to follow your lead, whether that means through intimidation, deception, or appealing to emotion. The use of charisma is not limited to coercing others to follow your lead, it also includes the effort to get others to appeal to your genuine interest or to read the intent of others. Most of the time, charisma checks are made against another character's willpower to determine the difficulty. Whether that character wants to believe you or not will also increase or decrease this difficulty by giving them advantage or disadvantage respectively.

#### Contacts (RES)

Sometimes you just know someone who can get what you need done, and if you don't, maybe you know how to find one. In a city or town there's always that somebody. This skill can be used to find people in urban areas where tracking them with perception can't get the job done. It is likely that this task may involve bribes or threats. This skill may even used to determine if you already have an existing rapport with newly introduced non-player characters. Often times using this skill can result in the creation of non-player characters solely to fulfill the purpose of the tasks, such as calling in favours or adding those characters as a reference for your character to call upon later.

#### Craft (INT)

Adventurers may often find themselves in unexpected situations. Crafting can allow for the improvisational construction of traps and tools, for tying strong knots, and even the repair of damaged items. While not necessarily a craft itself, it can even be used to appraise the quality of goods and equipment, or learn how to use unrecognizable equipment.

##### Table: Craft Common Tasks
| Task | Difficulty |
|:-|:-|
| Creating... | - |
| ...a basic improvised weapon | 10 (Easy) |

| ...a resting damaged artificial character | 20 (Hard) |
| ...a resting bloodied artificial character | 30 (Ambitious) |
| Stabilize a dying artificial character | 20 (Hard) |

Craft can also be used to make higher quality custom equipment. When doing so, it will require that you have a toolkit dedicated to the type of craft work you want to pursue (or a workshop containing those tools), and most importantly, a background, archetype, or other form of skillset that relates to the type of items you are crafting. If you do not possess some measure of these things, you can always work together with other characters.

#### Knowledge (INT)

Knowledge represents your ability to recall information. It can be anything from the widely available to the potentially unknown, such as historical events, people, or organizations to secret societies, or the occult. Primarly this skill is used to recall information specifically linked to your character's background, archetype, and other skills. Recalling information outside your character's expertise is much more difficult. This skill can also be used to make effective work studying new topics, with difficulty depending on your level of familiarity.

|:-|:-|

#### Perception (DEX)

Whether its traps, locks, pockets, or just fancy tricks, all such things are within your grasp. While this skill is generally used for everything a thief would do, it can also be used to conceal objects and perform tricks. This skill is also used to construct disguises for hiding in plain sight.

#### Wild Empathy (RES)

In the wild, many animals are unfriendly or fearful towards the majority of people. This skill allows you to speak to and calm down such animals. It can also be used to convince certain animals, like guard dogs, that you are friendly much in the same way you could use charisma to persuade someone. While this skill does not provide the ability to understand animals directly, it does provide the ability to share in confidence and trust, and to form an emotional bond with animals. Some animals that spend lots of time around people, like cats and dogs, are also capable of responding to very simple spoken requests once this trust is assured. The types of animals that do not might instead respond to simple gestures that can signal basic requests. This includes directing domesticated animals like cattle and horses.

#### Animism (RES)

Nature is a fundamental force that governs reality, and animism allows you to connect to that force. There are three specializations you can choose from which are the three different ethos of animism: *balance*, *entropy* and *harmony*.

Animists do not require or use scrolls or spell books. Nature itself teaches you how to wield it. You can only have one animism specialization, as they are fundamentally conflicting representations of animism. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your animism skill.

As you advance in animism you also get bonus spells at specific ranks depending on the specialization you choose. These ranks are trained (r4), practiced (r8), disciplined (r14), and master (r20). You get these spells in addition to the spells you learn from advancing normally.

##### Table: Animism Bonus Spells
| Roll Value | Step Name | Bonus Spell |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | [Speak with Animals](/Features/Powers#speak-with-animals) |
| r8 | Practiced | [Animal Form](/Features/Powers#animal-form) |
| r14 | Disciplined | ? |
| r20 | Master | ? |

##### Balance

Life and death are two sides of the same coin. Those that seek to control one or the other misrepresent the duality of nature. It is only by recognizing this balance that you can see nature as it truly is.

##### Entropy

All things must come to an end. This is the mantra of entropy, and you are an agent that represents this notion. Although you do not seek to destroy without cause, you will not hesitate to fulfil the inevitable truth.

##### Harmony

Nature is the universal machine to which all existing things are cogs. This machine cannot exist without its pieces holding it together. It is your mission to maintain all things that exist to satisfy the universal machine.

---

#### Faith (RES)

Most forms of spellcasting come from an internal source, either force of personality, or years of study. When it comes to faith that power is instead granted to an individual from a divine entity. Faith represents your devotion to following a code of beliefs that align with that divine entity, and the additional sacrifice of acting on behalf of that entity. Those who follow this lifestyle are often called clerics.

Like most other spellcasting skills, you will pick a specialization. However, unlike other casting skills, that specialization is created from several choices. There are three different choices to make along three different ideological axes: *altruism* or *militarism*, *impulse* or *discipline*, and *liberty* or *authority*. These choices combined result in eight different specializations: *charity*, *community*, *peace*, *service*, *anarchy*, *war*, *justice*, and *order*.

##### Table: Faith Specializations by Ideologies
| First Axis | Second Axis | Third Axis | Specialization<br/>Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Altruism | Impulse | Liberty | Charity |
| Altruism | Impulse | Authority | Community |
| Altruism | Discipline | Liberty | Peace |
| Altruism | Discipline | Authority | Service |
| Militarism | Impulse | Liberty | Anarchy |
| Militarism | Impulse | Authority | War |
| Militarism | Discipline | Liberty | Justice |
| Militarism | Discipline | Authority | Order |

Clerics do not require or use scrolls or spell books. You can only have one faith specialization, as it represents the core of your character's philosophical ideologies. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your faith skill. The spells available for you to choose are determined by each ideology chosen, rather than strictly the specialization itself.

As you advance in faith you also get bonus spells at specific ranks, depending on the specialization you choose. These ranks are practiced (r8), disciplined (r14), and master (r20). You get these spells in addition to spells you learn from advancing normally.

##### Table: Faith Bonus Spells
| Roll Value | Step Name | Charity | Community | Peace | Service | Anarchy | War | Justice | Order |
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| r8 | Practiced | [Mend](/Features/Powers#mend) | [Bless](/Features/Powers#bless) | [Inspire](/Features/Powers#inspire) | [Seek Guidance](/Features/Powers#seek-guidance) | [Curse](/Features/Powers#curse) | [Magic Weapon](/Features/Powers#magic-weapon) | [Spirit Communion](/Features/Powers#spirit-communion) | [Suggestion](/Features/Powers#suggestion) |
| r14 | Disciplined | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| r20 | Master | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

##### Altruism

When others are in need, it is you who will provide. This ideology spans the providence of both supportive actions and the gifting of material goods. Being altruistic is more than just providing when it is necessary, it is also the search for such opportunities.

##### Militarism

While kindness is an option, it is easier to demonstrate the cost of failure with a show of force. Militarism is not solely about violence: it is the drive to demonstrate your ideals even if others do not agree. What people want is not necessarily what people need.

##### Impulse

Opportunity is essentially a divine portent. Whenever opportunities arise that align with your goals they must be taken. Any other action is a failure to utilize the divine gift given to you. Searching for opportunities is not necessarily a goal, rather that opportunities are everywhere and just waiting to be seen.

##### Discipline

Action itself is less important than recognizing when that action is necessary. Although it may appear as though opportunities are constant, many of which can easily become distractions that prevent you from truly exemplifying your ideals at a better time.

##### Liberty

Freedom in all forms matters more to you than any one rule can provide. Although others are free to follow their own paths, if an individual or group's cause stands in the way of the freedom others, then that path is a restriction guised by a mask of freedom.

##### Authority

Governance without rule of law can quickly devolve into chaos. Without the guide of authority, actions are easily taken with disregard for consequence. This reckless behaviour can very easily have unintended effects. It is safer to follow law than act without guidance.

---

#### Ki

All things have some form of spirit, and ki is a manifestation of spirit in the form of an aura. Control over ki is control over one's own auras. Typically this form of magic is performed by those who meditate on the deeper parts of themselves. Those who can control their auras are often known as sōhei or monks. Ki has four different specializations to choose from which are the four auras: *genki*, *kiai*, *shouki*, and *yuuki*.

Monks do not require or use scrolls or spell books. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your ki skill. You can take this skill multiple times to learn how to control different auras. When you cast a spell using this skill, even if you have multiple specializations, you must cast that spell with the skill you learned it from. Each specialization casts spells using a different primary stat.

Monks of varying specializations can control the energies that govern their bodies. As you advance your ki skill, at specific ranks you gain the ability to convert your resources to another resource as a free action. These ranks are trained (r4), practiced (r8), disciplined (r14), and master (r20). Each specialization has its own resource conversion ability.

##### Genki "Vigour" (STR)

Control of the body, mastery of strength. Genki is the spirit of flesh and might. This aura can be utilized to increase your combat potential and push your strength beyond the natural limits one might think is possible.

##### Table: Genki Resource Conversion

|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 5 Endurance into 1 Stamina |
| r8 | Practiced | 4 Endurance into 1 Stamina |
| r14 | Disciplined | 3 Endurance into 1 Stamina |
| r20 | Master | 2 Endurance into 1 Stamina |

##### Kiai "Projection" (DEX)

Kiai is the spirit of your movement and the air you breathe, the air that feeds your body and mind. With the use of this aura your movements will become fast and effortless, the air around you will become an extension of your body.

##### Table: Kiai Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 5 Focus into 1 Stamina |
| r8 | Practiced | 4 Focus into 1 Stamina |
| r14 | Disciplined | 3 Focus into 1 Stamina |
| r20 | Master | 2 Focus into 1 Stamina |

##### Shouki "Mind" (INT)

Mastery of mind allows you to rely on the power of your thoughts and consciousness rather than the strength of your muscles. Your body will act as a mere vessel holding the extending reach of your mind.

##### Table: Shouki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 5 Stamina into 1 Focus |
| r8 | Practiced | 4 Stamina into 1 Focus |
| r14 | Disciplined | 3 Stamina into 1 Focus |
| r20 | Master | 2 Stamina into 1 Focus |

##### Yuuki "Courage" (RES)

This is the spirit that holds your body and mind together to act as a single force. With the embodiment of courage you need not body nor mind alone to prove yourself.

##### Table: Yuuki Resource Conversion
| Roll Value | Step Name | Resource<br/>Conversion |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| r4 | Trained | 1 Focus into 2 Endurance |
| r8 | Practiced | 1 Focus into 3 Endurance |

---

#### Sorcery (RES)

Sorcery is the natural style of spellcasting. It has seven specializations of a philosophical nature and are the seven classical elements: *air*, *earth*, *fire*, *water*, *light*, *darkness*, and *arcane*. In addition to this, sorcerers may instead choose any specialization available to the other spellcasting skills. Choosing an external specialization does not grant any other bonuses from spellcasting skill; it only provides access to that category of spells. For example: you could choose the wizardry specializations of: *augury*, *conjuration*, *enchantment*, *evocation*, or *transmutation*.

Sorcerers do not require or use scrolls or spell books; the magic sorcerers wield manifests from force of will rather than education. You acquire a new spell from your specialization when you advance your sorcery skill. You can take this skill multiple times to learn how to cast from different specializations. When you cast a spell using this skill, even if you have multiple specializations, you must cast that spell with the specialization you learned it from.

Sorcerers have it a bit easier than others when it comes to casting spells (as it feels like a natural extension of the self). As you advance in the sorcery skills, at specific ranks you can choose one of your learned spells to become a signature spell. These ranks are trained (r4), practiced (r8), disciplined (r14), and master (r20). All signature spells get a reduced casting difficulty and focus cost based on your advancement. This reduction only applies to spells within the same specialization (if you have multiple sorcery specializations you track each specialization's bonuses separately). 

##### Table: Sorcery Signature Spell Difficulty Reduction
| Roll Value | Step Name | Difficulty<br/>Reduction | Focus Cost<br/>Reduction |
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|
| r4 | Trained | -2 | - |
| r8 | Practiced | -3 | -1 |
| r14 | Disciplined | -4 | -1 |
| r20 | Master | -5 | -2 |

##### Air

Power over air allows you to control the wind itself. Lifting and moving objects become as easy to you as the wind can carry a leaf or feather. Sound and electricity are also associated with air.

##### Earth

Force and stability are the earth's primary strengths. The element of earth is a true testament to force of will. Additionally, this covers the domain of plants.

##### Fire

If you try hard enough just about anything can be burned. Strong emotions like anger and love are also aspects of fire. Fire is about passion and intensity.

##### Water

Water is about more than just getting things wet; water also represents flow and calming energy. Although sound is generally associated with air, you could say that music is also like water. Cold temperatures and cold elemental damage is also associated with water.

##### Light

While illumination is quite literal, and truth is quite philosophical, they are very similar in nature. Light is about revealing what is hidden.

##### Darkness

As a counter to light, darkness is about concealment. Darkness is not simply evil. Some truths are painful to bear, and darkness would rather hide those truths.

##### Arcane

The power of arcane represents the space between space. Many things that one might describe as blatantly magical are more accurately arcane. Arcane is a powerful force that seems to defy the normal rules that might apply to the other elements.

#### Wizardry (INT)

Wizardry is the educated style of spellcasting. It has five different specializations which are the five schools of magic: *augury*, *conjuration*, *enchantment*, *evocation*, and *transmutation*. The knowledge of spells in this way is represented by written material called scrolls which are essentially a page's worth of information for casting a single spell.

When you advance your wizardry skill you get both a spell learned from that specialization and a scroll of that spell. Having spells learned and having scrolls for spells both contribute to your ability to cast spells. There are three different ways to cast spells using wizardry: *casting a learned spell*, *using a spell scroll*, and *improvising a spell*.

When you cast a learned spell or cast a spell using a scroll, you may use any specialization you have that the spell belongs to. If you have both the spell learned and have a scroll, it is cast normally. If you only meet one of these conditions, then that spell is cast with disadvantage. Anyone (even non-wizards) may attempt to use scrolls to cast spells in specializations that they do not have, but they will only roll their intelligence (and with the usual disadvantage). Similarly, wizards may also use scrolls to cast spells that they are not advanced enough to learn using their skill (with disadvantage).

If a spell is not learned and a spell scroll is not available, spells may also be improvised. In this way, you may cast any spell from a specialization that you have. If you do, that spell is cast with double disadvantage. This can provide a great deal of flexibility to powerful wizards, but it is quite difficult.

Scrolls can also be acquired by purchasing them from other wizards (including spells that you cannot yet learn directly from advancement). The [cost](/Equipment/Items#table-scrolls) scrolls depends on the tier of the spell.

##### Augury

Augurs are the types of wizards who like to know things and solve problems. Augury can be used to learn information that would otherwise be unavailable, or solve simple problems that might require the use of someone with specialized skills.

##### Conjuration

Conjurors create illusions or magical tricks; they create effects that aren't real or have limited permanence. These types of effects are usually limited to things you can sense (see, hear, touch, taste, and smell).

##### Enchantment

Enchanting is the process of using magic to alter how things function, or improve how they function. This type of magic can be used on both objects and people, and usually results in effects that appear obviously supernatural.

##### Evocation

Evokers are normally known for one simple thing: destruction. It is true that evocation is a direct means to accessing destructive forces, but it can also be used to motivate and inspire. Evocation is really about activating deep emotions with the power of magic.

##### Transmutation

Transmuters can change one thing into something else, or repair what is broken. Transmutation focuses on the alteration of physical things, and does not necessarily provide results that one would assume are of a magical nature.
