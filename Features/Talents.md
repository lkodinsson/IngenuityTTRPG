**Cost:** 8/12/16 EXP

Instead of making a craft check to craft a magic item, you may create an unstable version of that item as an action and by spending focus and materials. Both the material cost of that item, and the focus cost, are determined by the item being created. Creating items in this way does not count as casting a spell, but you must still have the ability to cast the relevant spells of that item.

All items created by this ability lose their effects if not used before a week has passed since their creation. Items can only contain one synthesized magic effect at a time. Using this ability on an item that already contains a synthesized magic effect will replace the old one.
