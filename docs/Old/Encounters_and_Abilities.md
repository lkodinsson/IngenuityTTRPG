# Character Features

## Stats

Stats are numerical and fundamental properties of a character, primarily their physical properties. Some stats like *resources* and *defenses* are derived from other stats like *attributes* which describe the broad properties of a character.

### Attributes

Each character has four *attributes* which are used to derive other stats and abilities. These stats are: *strength*, *dexterity*, *intelligence*, and *resolve*. All attributes are represented by dice ranging from d4 to d12. Characters will start with dice values at either d4 or d6.

##### Table: Attributes Steps
| Dice Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| d4 | Weak |
| d6 | Good |
| d8 | Great |
| d10 | Excellent |
| d12 | Superb |

All actions and most features of characters rely on attributes. Typically this means rolling them (because they are represented by dice) when taking actions, but some other stats are instead determined mathematically from the value of your attributes. Strength and dexterity are used for physical actions and features, while intelligence and resolve are used for mental actions and features. For example: your character uses their strength to interact with heavy objects and to determine their maximum health.

### Resources

Survival and the use of special abilities requires managing stats known as *resources*. All resources are represented by *current* and *maximum* values where the current amount of that resource you can have is limited by its maximum and may be spent until they run out. *Health* and *endurance* are used to measure how well your character is surviving damage and physical stress, with endurance being easy to recover and health being difficult to recover. The other two resources are spent to perform special abilities, with *stamina* being used for physical abilities and *focus* being used for mental abilities.

### Defenses

When things happen to your character, your *defenses* are used to measure your character's response to those effects. *Fortitude* prepares your body for a physical challenge, *reflexes* prepare the body to move and react, and *willpower* prepares the mind to assess or mitigate influence. Against physical attacks you use your *deflection* and *damage resistance* which are influenced by your equipment.

### Fate

*Fate* is a very limited resource that belongs to you (the player) to exert influence over your dice rolls and extend the narrative control of your character to a limited degree. It is a powerful tool that must be used sparingly.

### Miscellaneous Stats

When your character wants to interact with the world, they have a few other stats which describe them and their physical limits. This includes the *speed* that your character can move, their physical *size*, and the number of items they can carry (as *item slots*)<!--, and their ability to carry heavy items (as a *weight score*)-->.

## Archetypes, Backgrounds, & Ancestries

*Archetypes*, often also called *classes*, are the core that a character is built from. Essentially they are a title that provides you with your initial set of abilities and provide context to the capabilities of your character. Although archetypes are responsible for your starting abilities, they are not a limitation for what your character can learn and become.

*Backgrounds* function similarly to archetypes as they provide a title and a description but they are more a reflection of a character's past than a character's present. In this way, the bonuses they provide to a character are much smaller but they are still a meaningful part of that character's identity.

Where your character comes from geographically or genetically is represented by their *ancestry*. This primarily determines your character's appearance and any natural abilities they have<!--, including modifiers to their stats, size, and speed-->. Classic fantasy races like *orcs*, *elves*, and *dwarves* are all types of ancestries, but this can even extend to your lineage or heritage like *british*, *danish*, or *japanese*.

## Skills

*Skills* represent practice in performing various groups of tasks and make certain types of actions easier for your character to perform. Like attributes, skill values are represented by dice. All skills have associated attributes that are rolled together with that skill whenever they are performed.

##### Table: Skill Steps
| Dice Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| d4 | Trained |
| d6 | Practiced |
| d8 | Adept |
| d10 | Expert |
| d12 | Master |

### Proficiencies

*Proficiencies* are precise activities, knowledge, or expertise that a character can use with one or more skills while interacting with the world. Unlike attributes and skills, proficiencies are not represented by dice. Instead they provide a bonus ranging from +1 to +5.

##### Table: Proficiencies Steps
| Bonus Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Nonproficient |
| +1 | Proficient |
| +2 | Practiced |
| +3 | Adept |
| +4 | Expert |
| +5 | Master |

### Skill Checks

If you take an action and success is not guaranteed, then you will need to make a *skill check*. To do so, you will roll your skill and an associated attribute together, add any one relevant proficiency, then compare your result to a *difficulty value* secretly determined by the Game Master. The result of this comparison will determine if you succeed at that task. For example: if you attempt to jump over a large pit you would need to roll your *strength* and *athletics*. If you had a proficiency in *jumping*, then you would add that as well. With a strength of d6, an athletics of d4, and a +1 to jumping, you would roll d6+d4+1.

All characters can use any skill even if they are not explicitly trained in that skill. If you do, then you will only roll that skill's associated stat because untrained skills provide no dice value to roll. This means it is very difficult to succeed with any skills untrained, because the difference between being trained and untrained is a whole additional die to roll. You would still add any relevant proficiency bonus. For example: if in the previous example you were not trained in athletics, you would only roll your strength of a d6 and add your +1 from being proficient in jumping.

In other circumstances where two characters are making a comparison of the same skill, those characters will make what is called an *opposed check*. The results of an opposed check will result in one side succeeding and one side failing, with the exception of ties where neither side wins. For example: two characters want to compare physical ability and engage in an arm wrestling contest. They will both make *athletics* checks, with the character rolling the highest winning the arm wrestle.

#### Challenge Difficulty

Challenges exist at various difficulties represented by a name and a value. The names of these difficulties can be used as a rough metric for determining the difficulty of any challenge, most of which will exist within the *easy* to *challenging* difficulty range. Anything that is a difficulty of *ambitious* or harder is much rarer. In order to succeed a skill check, the result of your roll must match or exceed the given difficulty value.

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty<br/>Value | Difficulty<br/>Name |
|:-:|:-|
| 3 | Easy |
| 6 | Moderate |
| 9 | Hard |
| 12 | Challenging |
| 15 | Ambitious |
| 18 | Absurd |
| 21 | Improbable |
| 24 | Unbelievable |

<!--
| 4 | Easy |
| 7 | Moderate |
| 10 | Hard |
| 13 | Challenging |
| 16 | Ambitious |
| 19 | Absurd |
| 22 | Improbable |
| 25 | Unbelievable |
-->

Typically when characters interact with each other, one is rolling to set the difficulty value for the other. For example: One character tries to sneak around another character. One will be making an *agility check* to attempt to sneak, while the other will be making a *perception check* to notice the sneaky character. In this case, the character rolling their perception is setting the difficulty value for the sneaking character.

<!--
#### Skill Duration

While most basic skills and actions can be performed in a matter of a couple seconds, some complex skills and actions cannot be performed so quickly. While it is expected that most complex actions that a character can take (as a result of skill checks) may take at least a few minutes, the exact duration is up to the Game Master based on the circumstances of the skill check. Some actions may even take several hours.
-->

#### Failure

When a skill check is attempted and results in a failure, typically the end result is that nothing happens. Usually once a task has failed, it cannot be attempted again (including by other characters) without considerable time or a change in circumstances.

Under circumstances with risk or tension, there may be additional consequences for failure. In this way, failure does not necessarily result in a dead end but can instead result in a change of circumstances or advance the scene. Instead, failure should be seen as an opportunity to explore alternative actions.

### The Luck Die

In addition to the dice you roll during a skill check, you will also roll a twenty-sided-die called the *luck die*. If the luck die results in a value of 20 or greater, then you receive an additional +3 to your skill check.

#### Pure Luck

In special circumstances where luck is a factor and the skill of your character will not change the outcome, instead of making a skill check you will roll the luck die on its own. In this case, the result of your luck die will determine the outcome. Often this means comparing that result to a secret number instead of just providing a bonus on a roll of 20 or greater.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Occasionally, circumstance, clever roleplaying, or the use of one of your abilities will provide you with *advantage*. For each source of advantage you have to a roll, you may reroll a die of your choice and keep the better result. *Disadvantage* works similarly to advantage, but instead of keeping the better result you must keep the worst result. The die that you reroll when you have disadvantage is the die with the greatest result. Advantage and disadvantage do not affect your luck die.

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, then it would require an equal amount of disadvantage to entirely cancel out.

### Types of Skills

Skills fit into two categories: *mundane skills* and *supernatural skills*. Each of the individual [skills](/Features/Skills) have tables detailing common tasks that you can expect along with their expected difficulty. The use of skills is not limited in this way but rather they are fully capable of anything you can imagine within the skill's description. Some skills are very widely applicable like *athletics* and *agility* for nearly all physical tasks, *insight* for most mental tasks, and *charisma* for most social tasks. Other skills like *contacts* or *craft* have a much more narrow degree of application, yet can still be very useful.

#### Mundane Skills

Most actions that characters take when interacting with the game world are handled by the mundane skills: *agility*, *athletics*, *charisma*, *combat*, *contacts*, *craft*, *handling*, *insight*, *perception*, and *taming*. Skills are extended by special abilities called *maneuvers* which can be used by anyone. Characters can also choose to learn individual maneuvers to reduce their stamina cost.

#### Supernatural Skills

Most other special abilities that characters can take are handled by the supernatural skills. There are nonmagical supernatural skills: *metapowers*, *psionics*, and *superpowers*; and magical supernatural skills: *animism*, *communion*, *ki*, *sorcery*, and *wizardry*. These skills encompass both magical and nonmagical sources of supernatural abilities which are called *powers*. Unlike maneuvers which can be used by anyone, powers require training in both a matching skill and proficiency.

<!--Future spellcasting skills: incantation/invocation and runecasting-->

<!--
##### Table: Power Tier Learning Limit
| Skill | Proficiency | Highest Tier |
|:-:|:-:|:-|
| d4 | +1 | 1 (Lesser) |
| d8 | +2 | 2 (Greater) |
| d12 | +3 | 3 (Epic) |
-->

### Types of Proficiencies

A character can have a proficiency in more or less anything that a player can imagine knowing or doing. Proficiencies are broad enough to be usable in a few different activities but specific enough to encompass a single thematic skillset. There is a recommended list of [proficiencies](/Features/Proficiencies) to help players make thematic decisions and provide consistency. These recommended proficiencies are primarily separated into multiple categories: *activity*, *environment*, *influence*, and *knowledge*.

Sometimes other character features like ancestries and skills can have other special proficiencies. Although these are primarily for granting access to specific abilities from their associated skills (like supernatural skills), these types of proficiencies can still be acquired without access to those character features. The use of those proficiencies does not need to be limited to their associated skills.

#### Languages

The languages that a character can speak are represented as a type of proficiency. Normally, when your character speaks their native lnaguage you don't need to make any skill checks. However, whenever your character tries to use a language that they aren't native in, they will need to make a skill check using either *insight* (to read) or *charisma* (to speak). New languages are acquired the same as any proficiency, and when a character becomes a master of that language, the character becomes fluent and skill checks stop being required to use that language.

To simplify language use, all characters can have access to the same base language (called either *Common* or *English*) to simplify player to player communication.

## Talents & Traits

*Talents* provide special abilites or modify the overall function of your character. They are the primary way to improve your character beyond just adjusting their numerical properties like with stats, skills, and proficiencies.

*Traits* function similarly to talents but have more room for customization and personalization. They provide opportunities to roleplay in a unique way and help make your character stand out from other similar characters.

# Encounters and Abilities

## Encounters

Encounters are time-sensitive scenarios where each action you take matters. Encounters typically begin in a few different ways:

* When two or more groups intend to perform actions that oppose each other (combat and non-combat).
* When a character is aware of a potential danger and intends to be deliberate and calculating with their actions.
* When there is a limited amount of time to overcome a complex challenge.

Encounters from start to end follow this sequence:

1. All participants will compare their reflexes to determine which team goes first.
2. If some participants are surprised by combat, the aggressors may take turns during a surprise round.
3. After the surprise round (if any), all teams take turns alternating with one participant each, until all participants have acted. This then repeats until the encounter ends.

#### Initiative

When it comes time to begin an encounter each character will compare their *reflexes* which is determined by their passive *dexterity* and *resolve*. The team with the highest individual initiative goes first. On a tie, the player team goes first. Each team will take turns choosing one character to act and will alternate teams one character each until all characters have acted. Players can choose to take their turns in any order and may change the order in which they take their turns during each subsequent round. For example: Four players attempt to sneak up on two guards. They fail to be stealthy and alert the guards who begin to attack the players. All six characters will compare their reflexes. One of the players has the highest reflexes so their team will go first. Player #1 will act, then Guard #1, Player #2, Guard #2, Player #3, and finally Player #4. Because there were only two guards, their team did not have any additional characters to take turns between Players #3 and #4. On subsequent rounds, those players may choose to act in a different order but will still alternate one character per team.

#### Rounds

Each round represents about six seconds in the game world, meaning there are 10 rounds in a minute. During each round each character will be able perform multiple actions. When an effect refers to a number of rounds, this means from the start of the character's turn in which that effect began until the start of their turn in a future round but before they take any actions. If that character is removed from taking turns in the encounter then that effect triggers at the end of the round after all other characters have taken their actions.

In other cases, encounters which can be better described as complex challenges do not require an exact duration of a player's turn. Instead, there is simply a series of challenges to overcome in a given time frame. In this way, players are simply performing a series of skill checks in addition to any other actions (assuming all player's spend roughly the same amount of time) and taking turns doing so.

<!-- The most basic combat scenarios may be considered complex challenges rather than tactical combat encounters if the results of that combat have minimal consequences. This can allow those combats to be more narrative than tactical. In these situations it is more common for simple enemies to go down in a single hit, while elite enemies will require more significant damage before becoming defeated. -->
<!-- The above information is probably more useful in a GMG rather than here. -->

## Actions

During an encounter with concrete turn length (such as tactical combat) you can perform up to three [actions](/Appendix/Actions) during your turn. By default all game actions take up one of your actions per turn. Specific actions will state if they take more than one action. Actions that are longer than a single turn (more than three actions) are considered *extended actions*. You may take any action with any action cost (including more than you have available) but they only resolve when the full action cost is paid. When an extended action is started, it may be cancelled at any point during one of your future turns before it finishes. 

Once during each round when it is not your turn, you may still take certain actions called *reactions* (that is from the start of your turn to the start of your next turn). These types of actions have a trigger condition which allows you to perform them. For example: the *evade* action is a reaction that allows you to make an agility skill check instead of your deflection when you are targeted by an attack.

In addition to actions and reactions, there are also *free actions* and *free reactions*. These types of actions do not take up your actions per turn or reactions per round.

Under normal circumstances you will dictate what you do rather than specifying the exact game action you take. In the case of special abilities, these aspects of your character are more under you control. Instead you declare exactly what ability you are using, and then describe what your character does as it performs that action. For example: You might say, *"I jump across the pit,"* which may require you to roll a skill check to succeed. Alternatively, you could instead say, *"I cast the spell Feather Fall then jump across the pit,"* and it might make it easy enough that you don't need to roll at all.

#### Group Actions

Characters can work together on a task to increase their likelihood of success. In this case, all characters will make the same skill check for that action and use the single highest result. For example: If multiple characters are searching a room for a secret door or hidden object, only one of them needs to succeed. They may all take this action at the same time and simply declare the highest result.

#### Assisting an Action

In situations where only one character can perform the task but other character still want to help, they may instead assist the character performing the task. To do so, they must perform the exact same skill check using the same attribute, skill, and proficiency. This provides a bonus to that character's skill check based on the highest threshold that the assisting character's roll meets or exceeds.

##### Table: Assist Thresholds
| <nobr>Assist Roll</nobr><br/>Threshold | Assist Bonus |
|:-:|:-:|
| 6 (Moderate) | +1 |
| 12 (Challenging) | +2 |
| 18 (Absurd) | +3 |
| 24 (Unbelievable) | +4 |

## Concentration

Some abilities or effects may require you to maintain *concentration*. Concentration can only be used to maintain a single ability or effect at a time. If at any point you are required to maintain concentration on multiple effects at once, you must choose one to maintain and the rest to lose. In this way concentration acts like a limited resource but you never lose the ability to concentrate by spending it.

Concentration requires an active and conscious mind. If at any point you become unconscious, then you automatically lose your concentration. If you become stunned, you may make a willpower check against the source that provided the stun. If successful, the concentration is maintained. If the source does not have a difficulty value, then make the check against a difficulty of 9 (hard) instead. If at any point an ability requiring concentration would otherwise end, such as from its duration expiring, the ability can be instantly reactivated (any costs must be repaid) to restart its duration and prevent concentration from being broken.

## Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, trap, or by any means, they will take damage. Any damage dealt to a character is taken first to their endurance and the difference to their health if no endurance remains. When a character is dealt damage, if they would then have zero endurance and are reduced to less than zero health (health can be negative), that character is given the [dying](/Appendix/Conditions#dying) condition. If they are reduced to exactly zero health, they are only given the [unconscious](/Appendix/Conditions#unconscious) condition.

Damaging items or objects is done by making the relevant skill checks against a difficulty value based on the perceived difficulty to break that item or object (as determined by the Game Master). For example: breaking a door with an axe could be a combat check against an arbitrary difficulty value (if the door was made of wood, it could be easy).

<!--Damage that is halved or doubled multiple times are modified at an altered rate. If damage would be halved twice, it is instead reduced into a third. If it would be halved again, it is reduced to a quarter, and so on. Similarly, if damage is doubled twice, it is instead increased to a triple. If it would be douled again, it is increased to a quadruple, and so on.-->

#### Damage Types

There are three main categories of damage types: *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless*. The majority of damage is dealt as physical damage, which has three types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. Most sources of damage will deal one of these three types of damage. Most other damage is dealt as elemental damage. The types of elemental damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*. Any time a damage type is not listed as one of the physical or elemental damage types it can be considered typeless damage.

## Conditions

The duration of any given [condition](/Appendix/Conditions) is determined by its source. Unless otherwise specified, most conditions are temporary and multiple conditions of the same type do not stack.

<!--The following text is possibly unnecessary?-->

Temporary conditions that alter your attributes do not also alter other stats derived from them; they only modify your rolls with those attributes (such as skill checks). For example: A character with a strength of d6 is given a temporary effect which increases their strength by +1. This results in a strength of d6+1 which changes their athletics and some combat rolls, but does not change their fortitdue and maximum health.

In contrast, permanent effects that alter your attributes do alter your derived stats. For example: If you were given a permanent effect giving you a -1 to your strength, then you would need to reduce your fortitude and maximum health.

## Maneuvers

[Maneuvers](/Features/Maneuvers) are special abilities that anyone can use and that typically require the use of a skill check. Maneuvers have various types: *offensive*, *defensive*, or *tactical*. Typically, offensive maneuvers perform attacks, defensive maneuvers defend yourself or others, and tactical maneuvers provide special actions. <!--Add more types; Social?-->

<!--Move this section to Creation and Advancement
#### Acquiring Maneuvers

Whenever you become trained in or advance your rank in a combat skill you learn a [maneuver](/Features/Maneuvers) that matches that combat skill. Maneuvers cost stamina and can only be used once each round. Any characters that start with combat skills also start with an appropriate number of learned maneuvers based on their rank. Maneuvers learned from advancing one combat skill can be used by your other combat skills, so long as they could also be learned by the other skill. For example: You advance your *unarmed* skill and learn *heavy strike*. If you were also trained in *martial* then you could also use *heavy strike* with *martial*.
-->

#### Performing Maneuvers

<!--
Performing a maneuver usually has two parts: an attack and an effect. Each maneuver will list the order these things occur and how they interact with the target. Effects can be resisted by the target similar to how attacks can be defended. They will compare their stat listed for the resist against the attack roll. If the resist is successful (it exceeds the attack roll) then the additional effects of the maneuver are negated. For example: You perform a *crippling strike* maneuver against a target. First you make an attack, then if the attack hits, the target compares their resist stat. If your maneuver's combat roll was a 6 and the defender's resist was a 7, then *crippling strike* applies no additional effect beyond dealing damage from the hit.
-->

#### Improvising Maneuvers

<!--
Even if you do not have a maneuver learned from advancing a combat skill, maneuvers may still be used. This is called *improvising a maneuver*. When you do, you perform it as normal but with an additional cost of your choice: the stamina cost is increased by 1; or the action type is increased by one action (if possible). For example: You do not have the *feint* maneuver learned and want to improvise it. If you decide you do not want to waste any stamina, it then requires two actions instead of the normal one action to use.

This means that all maneuvers are available to all characters but doing so is inefficient for the untrained. There are very few maneuvers that cannot be improvised.
-->

## Powers

[Powers](/Features/Powers) function very similarly to maneuvers but are instead manipulations of reality using some other kind of supernatural influence. There are various different supernatural skills that provide powers, with each skill having its own list of proficiencies that provide access to different powers. Many of these proficiencies access to many of the same powers, which means different sources can provide what are essentially the same supernatural effects, even if one is magic and the other not.

Powers are separated into tiers which determine both their focus cost and difficulty to perform. Although this is the primary determining factor, some powers have additional rules which may allow you to modify these values. These modifications only change how the power is performed and not what tier they belong to.

##### Table: Power Tiers
| Tier | Tier Name | Focus Cost | Difficulty |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Lesser | 1 | 3 (Easy) |
| 2 | Greater | 2 | 6 (Moderate) |
| 3 | Epic | 3 | 9 (Hard) |

#### Performing Powers

Although there are many different ways to acquire powers they are all performed the same way:

1. Wait for the complete action time required to use the power.
2. Make a skill check with your power skill versus the power's difficulty. This includes rolling the luck die as normal.
3. Spend focus equal to that power's cost if you succeed. Otherwise, spend only 1 focus.
4. The targets (if any) may choose to resist the effects of that power (if allowed).
5. Perform the effects of that power based on your roll versus the resists of your targets (if any).

If you succeeded your check against the power's difficulty, then you will perform that power as listed in its description. Failure to perform a power results in no effect. If that power results in an amount of something, like damage or healing, then that amount is equal to the result of your skill check, plus any bonuses described by the power.

If the targets of your power choose to resist the effects, they will use or stat or skill specified by that spell's resist against your skill check for that power.<!--If the targets are also provided future opportunities to resist, they will continue to be made against the same result.--> Unless a power states otherwise, all effects of that power are negated if the skill check fails against the resist.

Additional powers used during the same turn get a -3 penalty for each power used before it in the same turn. This is known as the *multiple power penalty*. Powers used as a reaction are exempt from this penalty (such as by a readied action).

## Recovering

At some point during an adventure you may find yourself low on your resources and you will need to spend time taking a *break* or a *rest* to recover them. Breaks and rests recover different amounts of each of your resources and require different amounts of time to complete. Breaks are short and easy to take anywhere but rests require significant amounts of time and relative safety.

#### Breaks

A break is basically a short amount of time to relax from strenuous activity. Whenever you go to relax, meditate, or make simple preparations over a period of thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a break. An extended period of up to two hours containing a single simple activity, such as performing research or crafting an item with a low difficulty (of 3 or less) can also be considered a break.

After a successful break, each of your endurance, stamina, and focus recover by half of their maximum (rounded up). For example: if you have a maximum stamina of 8, then you would recover 4 stamina during a break.

Breaks can only be taken up to two times in between each rest.

#### Rests

A rest occurs when you sleep uninterrupted for approximately eight hours.

After a successful rest, each of endurance, stamina, and focus recover to full. Additionally, health recovers by 1 and any abilities that can be used a number of times per rest are also recovered. If a rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered incomplete and only half of the normal resources are recovered instead. The rest may be resumed within two hours to complete the rest and recover the remaining resources.

<!--Reword based on new skills & proficiencies
Characters with substantial wounds will require substantial rest to recover. Characters may treat the wounds of another character before they take a rest by using the medicine skill against a difficulty of 6 (Moderate). This is increased to 9 (Hard) if that character currently has negative health. If successful, the amount of health that character recovers during that rest is increased by 1 (to 2).
-->

Rests can only be taken once each day (usually at night). Tracking exhaustion for sleepless nights is an [optional rule](/Extended_Systems/Advanced_Ailments#fatigue), but it is recommended.
