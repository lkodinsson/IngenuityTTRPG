# Playing the Game

## Tests

Whenever you attempt a task and success is not guaranteed, then you will need to make a *test*. To do so, you will roll a relevant *attribute* and *skill*, add any one relevant *proficiency*, then compare your result to a secretly determined *difficulty value*. In order to succeed at a task, the result of a test must meet or exceed the difficulty of the task.

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty | Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Trivial |
| 3 | Easy |
| 6 | Moderate |
| 9 | Hard |
| 12 | Challenging |
| 15 | Ambitious |
| 18 | Absurd |
| 21 | Improbable |
| 24 | Unbelievable |

> ***Example***  
> Fabian attempts to pick a locked door.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *dexterity* and *handling* for this test.
> They also notice that Fabian has the *sleight* proficiency, which they can use for this task.
> With a dexterity of d6, a handling of d4, and a sleight of +1, Fabian rolls d6+d4+1.
> The test results in a value of 7, which the game master determines is enough to succeed at the task.

All characters can perform *any* test, even if they are untrained and nonproficient. If a character is lacking in either a skill and/or proficiency, then they will perform that test using whatever they have.

> ***Example***  
> Priscilla attempts to climb a single story wall using a rope and grappling hook.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics* for this test.
> However, Priscilla does not have athletics or any relevant proficiency.
> With only a strength of d4, Priscilla rolls a d4.
> The test results in a value of 3. The game master determines that in spite of lacking both athletics and a relevant proficiency, because they used climbing tools the task was easy and they succeed at the task.

Typically, tasks of a trivial nature never require tests. However, for sufficiently proficient characters, even more difficult tasks may eventually become trivial. With a sufficiently high enough bonus from a proficiency, the lowest possible roll can eventually catch up to some difficulty values.

> ***Example***  
> Over time Fabian improves his stats and attempts a familiar task: picking a locked door.
> The game master notices that he has a d6 in handling and has a +4 in sleight.
> The lowest possible roll that Fabian can achieve is a 6.
> The difficulty to pick the lock was also a 6, so the game master decides that he doesn't need to roll any dice to determine the outcome of the test.

### Failure

When a test is performed and does not meet or exceed the difficulty, the test *fails* and the desired outcome is not achieved. However, this does not necessarily result in a dead end or that nothing happens. There may instead be additional consequences for failure, such as escalating risk. In this way, failure is more often a change of circumstances than it is a dead end. Failure should be viewed more as an opportunity to push your luck or explore alternate decisions.

> ***Example***  
> Priscilla attempts to climb the side of a mansion to the third floor using a rope and grappling hook.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics* for this test.
> However, Priscilla does not have athletics or any relevant proficiency.
> With only a strength of d4, Priscilla rolls a d4.
> The test results in a value of 2. Unfortunately, this is well below what the game master has determined is necessary to reach the third floor. Priscilla fails her test.
> Part way up the wall the grappling hook becomes loose and Priscilla begins to fall.

When a test is failed during a *scene* or an *actvitiy*, the character performing the test has three options:

* Escalate the task
* Modify the task
* Abandon the task

ESCALATE THE TASK

MODIFY THE TASK

ABANDON THE TASK

TIME AND PROGRESS (TO RETRY)

### Contests

When two characters are making tests against each other, this is called a *contest*. Usually this means that one character is setting the difficulty for the other. These types of contests resolve the same way as normal tests.

> ***Example***  
> Markos is sneaking around the palace and the guards are on high alert.
> When Markos makes his test for stealth, the guards will make a test to search for intruders.
> In this way, the guards are setting the difficulty for Markos' stealth test.

In circumstances where characters are performing the same activity against each other, they are both setting the difficulty for each other. Normally when performing a test you must meet or exceed the difficulty, but in this type of circumstance one of the characters must *exceed* the other.

> ***Example***  
> Arnbjorg and Siegmund engage in an arm wrestle.
> The game master determines that to perform this test they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics*.
> They also notice that Arnbjorg has the *lifting* proficiency, which they can use for this task.
> They both roll strength and athletics, and Arnbjorg adds their lifting proficiency as a bonus.
> Arnbjorg rolls an 11 while Siegmund rolls an 8.
> Arnbjorg beats Siegmund at the arm wrestle.

Tests like this usually repeat on a tie until one character beats the other, or as a tug-of-war until one side successively beats the other.

### Luck

In addition to the dice you roll during a test, you will also roll a d20 called the *luck die*. If the luck die results in a value of *20 or greater*, then you receive a +3 to the result of your roll for that test. Do not add the value on your luck die directly to your test roll. This does not guarantee success.

> ***Example***  
> Milo attempts to leap over a 3m pit.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *dexterity* and *agility* for this test.
> They also notice that Milo has the *jumping* proficiency, which they can use for this task.
> With a dexterity of d6, an agility of d4, and a jumping of +1, Milo rolls d6+d4+1, and the d20 *luck die*.
> Milo rolls a 9 for his test and rolls a 20 on his luck die. He adds a +3 to his roll, resulting in a 12 for the test.
> The game master determines that 12 is more than enough to succeed at the task.

In rare circumstances where only luck is a factor, you may instead be asked to make a *luck test*. If you do, roll the luck die on its own instead of making a normal test.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Circumstance, clever role-playing, or the use of one of your abilities may provide you with *advantage*. For each source of advantage that you have while performing a test, you may reroll one die of your choice and you may keep the better result.

Conversely, you may sometimes find yourself with *disadvantage*. If you do, you must instead reroll one die with the greatest result and you *must* keep the worse result.

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, then it would require an equal amount of disadvantage to completely cancel out.

Neither advantage or disadvantage can be used to reroll the luck die.

## Combat

When a group of characters intends harm on another group of characters, the situation turns into *combat*. Usually this occurs because each team is focused on conflicting *objectives* and combat is a method of stopping opposing teams from interfering with that objective.

Participants in combat are separated into *teams*. Teams and their *members* will take turns performing actions until one team remains or one team completes their objective. In rare situations, a team's objective may change from one round of combat to another.

### Initiative and Rounds

The *team* in a combat encounter with the highest *initiative* will go first, followed by each other team with the next highest initiative. On a tie, the team containing the players goes first. A team's initiative is equal to the highest *reflexes* that any one member of that team has.

> ***Example***  
> The players accidentally alert some guards who sound the alarm and begin to attack.
> On the player's team, Clementine has the highest reflexes of 5, so their team has an initiative of 5.
> On the guard's team, they all have a reflexes of 5, so their team also has an initiative of 5.
> Since both teams have the same initiative, the player's team will go first.

Once team order has been determined, the combat will enter into *rounds*. Each round represents about *six seconds* in the game world, meaning there are about *ten rounds* in *one minute*. During each round, each participant in the combat will each get *one turn*. Each team will select one member to take a turn, and then pass to the next team, until each team has given all of their members a turn. Once this happens, the next round begins.

> ***Example***  
> The players go first, and they decide to let Roland take the first turn so he can get into a good position.
> Next, the guards will decide to let their captain take a turn so he can rally the troops.
> Then the players will go again, this time selecting Clementine who attacks one of the guards.
> Then the guards will go again, selecting a guard who is nearby Roland who will then attack him.
> Teams will continue to alternate until all participants have taken their turns.
> The round will then end and the next round will begin, repeating the process.

During new rounds, players may decide to take their turns in a different order than in a previous round.

If one team has much fewer members than another team, then they simply run out of members to give turns to. This means that any remaining teams with members may still continue to assign turns. Try not to get outnumbered.

> ***Example***  
> During a round the players manage to defeat a few of the guards, resulting in lopsided teams of four players versus two guards.
> On a future round, once both the players and the guards have taken two turns each, only the players will have members on their team left to act.
> Since this is the case, each of them may simply take their turns in any order they like as there are no other teams with remaining members to give turns to.

If at any time a character becomes unable to act (such as by becoming unconscious), they lose the ability to take a turn. When they regain consciousness, they may take their turn at the next possible opportunity.

> ***Example***  
> During combat with the guards, one of them managed to knock Roland unconscious before he could take his turn.
> However, on Clementine's turn she managed to resuscitate Roland and return him to consciousness.
> Since a player just took a turn, it passes to the guard's team (if they have any members left to act).
> After the guards take a turn, the players may decide to give Roland the next turn.

### Surprise

Sometimes circumstances will lead a team to have the advantage of *surprise*. This can happen by using stealth or by starting combat when the opponents were not expecting it. In this case, the team with the benefit of surprise gets to take a whole round where only their team may take actions. After this round, teams will alternate taking turns as normal.

> ***Example***  
> While exploring a room the players start to make a lot of noise.
> As a result, a few goblins hear them and stealthily approach their position.
> The players fail to detect the goblins, so they catch the players by surprise.
> The goblins then proceed to all take turns as they attack the players.

During a surprise round, if there are any characters that do not have the advantage of surprise but also cannot be surprised, then they may take actions as normal even if the rest of their team cannot. In this case, the initiative of the teams are compared as normal during the surprise round instead of only when normal rounds begin.

> ***Example***  
> Thankfully, Clementine has the *danger sense* talent and cannot be surprised.
> During the surprise round, Clementine defeats one of the goblins.
> As a result, there is one less goblin attacking them during the surprise round.
> After the surprise round, normal rounds begin and each team takes their turns as normal.

### Actions

Each turn in combat, characters may take *three actions*. Since each round is considered to represent *six seconds* of time passing, each action represents *two seconds*. By default, any [action](/Appendix/Actions) you can take during a turn is considered to take *one action* unless otherwise specified. Some actions will also specify if they require you to spend additional resources like *stamina* or *focus*.

##### Table: Actions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Activity | Three actions. Perform a complex task that requires making a test |
| Attack | Make an attack unarmed or with a held item against a target |
| Brandish | Choose what items you are holding in your hands |
| Command | Once per turn, spend 1 focus to target an ally to take an action during your turn |
| Interact | Use an object in the immediate area such as doors and inventory items |
| Guard | End the turn but gain a +1 bonus to *all* defensive stats and tests until next turn |
| Move | Once per turn, move up to your speed |
| Ready an Action | Declare any action with a trigger condition and end the turn. Prepare that action as a reaction until taken or until the next turn |
| Resuscitate | Two actions. Go prone, then make a test to return someone to consciousness |
| Seek Cover | Give ranged attackers disadvantage while behind cover until next turn |
| Sprint | If you have already moved this turn, spend 1 stamina to take another move action |
| Stand Up | Get up from being prone |
| Wait | End the turn but gain an extra reaction until next turn |

During each *round*, characters may also take up to *one reaction*. Reactions can be taken on any character's turn and are recovered at the start of each turn.

##### Table: Reactions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Block | Spend 1 stamina to use a shield to redirect incoming damage |
| Evade | Spend 1 stamina to attempt to avoid an attack by making a test |
| Intercept | Spend 1 stamina to move to then trade places with an ally against an attack |
| Parry | Spend 1 stamina to use an item to add to your deflection and protection |
| Resist | Spend 1 stamina or focus to take a test to reattempta defence against an effect |

Actions that are longer than a single turn (more than six seconds or three actions) are called *extended actions*. Extended actions and any other action which takes more actions than you have left in a turn can be taken the same as any other action, but you must wait until the *full action time* has occurred before you can perform the effects of that action. If during a future turn you wish to abandon an action that you have already started, you may do so at no extra cost and take your turn as normal.

> ***Example***  
> During her turn, Petra *fired her crossbow* at an enemy, then she decided to *seek cover*.
> Reloading her crossbow requires that she takes *two actions* but she only has *one action* remaining.
> She decides to start reloading her crossbow with her remaining action.
> On her next turn, in order to finish reloading she will need to spend her *first action* to finish reloading the crossbow before she can take any other actions.

Actions that are longer than a single turn (more than six seconds or three actions) are called *extended actions*. You may take *any* action that requires more than you have left by spending actions from future turns. However, the action will only be completed once the *full action time* has passed. You may cancel an action started this way at any time during your turn at no extra cost, and take your turn as normal.

Some actions may also be *free actions* or *free reactions*, which do not count against your action and reaction limit per turn.

##### Table: Free Actions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Drop Item | Drop any held item onto the ground |
| Drop Prone | Become prone, giving ranged attackers disadvantage and melee attackers advantage |
| Step | Once per turn, take a 1m step instead of a move action |

### Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, a trap, or by any means, they will take *damage*. Damage is separated into multiple categories such as *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless* damage. Most sources of damage will deal either physical or elemental damage. If a type is not specified, then it can be considered typeless damage. Normally, only physical and elemental damage can be reduced by your *damage reduction* stats.

##### Table: Damage Types
| Name | Type |
|:-|:-|
| Arcane | Elemental |
| Bludgeoning | Physical |
| Cold | Elemental |
| Fire | Elemental |
| Piercing | Physical |
| Psychic | Typeless |
| Radiant | Elemental |
| Shock | Elemental |
| Slashing | Physical |
| Void | Elemental |

Any damage dealt to a character is first reduced by their matching *damage reduction* (to a *minimum of 1*), then taken to their *endurance*. If no endurance remains, then the difference is dealt to their *health*. If they would be reduced to *exactly zero health*, then they become *unconscious*. If they are instead reduced to an amount of *negative health*, then they become both unconscious and *dying*. Characters that recover from dying will remain at whatever negative health they have. Should they take any more damage to their health again, they will once again become unconscious and dying.

### Conditions

Occasionally characters suffer effects from attacks, traps, or special abilities. These types of effects are called [*conditions*](/Appendix/Conditions).

##### Table: Example Conditions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Blinded | Provides disadvantage to all actions that require a target |
| Bloodied | The character has taken damage into negative health |
| Cover | Hiding behind cover. Provides disadvantage to ranged attackers |
| Dying | Making tests to not lose more health and eventually die |
| Prone | On the ground. Provides disadvantage to ranged attackers and advantage to melee attackers |
| Stunned | Lose an action at the start of next turn. Interrupts actions and breaks concentration |
| Unconscious | Unable to take any actions |
| Wounded | The character has taken damage to their health |

By default, conditions are temporary and a character cannot have multiple instances of the same condition unless otherwise specified. Usually this means that the newest or most powerful instance of a condition takes precedence. Normally when a condition is applied, it will specify a duration or a circumstance that allows the condition to expire. If it does not, then it is up to the discretion of the game master.

## Special Abilities

### Maneuvers

<!--*Maneuvers* are abilities that require spending either *stamina* or *focus*, making a test, and then receiving a special effect. Anyone may perform a maneuver, but characters that have learned specific maneuvers receive a bonus when performing that maneuver.-->

-->

### Fate

At any time, 1 point of *fate* may be spent to achieve any one of the following effects:

* Ask the game master any one question about the current scene, which they must answer truthfully
* Maximize a single die during a test you roll (including the luck die)
* Take an additional action during your turn in combat
* Choose one of endurance, stamina, or focus, to recover by half of their maximum
* Reduce a single source of incoming damage received to half
* Perform a character advancement during the current scene, reducing the experience cost to half
* Prevent your character from dying at the cost of inhibiting their motivation or ambition

You may spend multiple fate points at the same time.

## Recovering Resources

During your adventures you may find yourself low on your resources. In order to recover them you will need to take either a *break* or a *rest*.

### Breaks

A break is a short amount of time spent not performing any strenuous activities. Whenever you go to relax, meditate, or make simple preparations over a period of about thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a break.

After a successful break, each of your *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, each recover by half of their maximum.

> ***Example***  
> After taking a break, if your maximum endurance is 8, then you will recover 4 endurance.

Additionally, breaks may contain a single simple activity such as performing research or crafting an item. The task in question must be easy (difficulty value of 3 or less), and the time required for the break is extended to require at least two hours.

> ***Example***  
> Justinia decides to visit the local library to read up on books about the occult. She spends several hours there reading books to discover clues. The singular task was both simple and easy, so she was able to recover some focus that she spent earlier in the session.

Breaks can only be taken up to *two* times in between each rest.

### Rests

A rest is a large amount of time usually spent sleeping for approximately eight hours.

After a successful rest, each of your *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, each recover an amount equal to their maximum. Additionally, *health* recovers by exactly 1 and any special abilities that can be used a number of times per rest recover all of their uses.

> ***Example***  
> Georgios sleeps for the night. When he awakens, he recovers all of his endurance, stamina, and focus, as well as 1 point of health since he was injured during the previous day. Since he also used his *second wind* talent, it recovers its per day use.

If a rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered an *incomplete rest* and only half of the normal amount of endurance, stamina, and focus are recovered. The rest may be resumed within a couple hours to properly rest and recover all of the remaining resources.

> ***Example***  
> Haldir sets up camp and sleeps for the night. He awakens in the middle of the night to a wolf eating his food supplies. He recovers only half of his endurance, stamina, and focus. He does not recover any health or ability uses. If he can deal with the wolf and return to sleep soon, then he will be able to recover the rest of his resources.

Rests can only be taken up to once each day (usually at night).

Tracking [exhaustion](/Extended_Systems/Advanced_Ailments#fatigue) for sleepless night is a recommended but optional rule.

### Fate

Unlike other resources, Fate does *not* recover during a rest or a break. Instead, characters gain 1 fate at the beginning of each game session. Spend them *wisely*.

Characters cannot have more than 3 fate at one time. If a character already has 3 fate when they gain another, then they gain zero fate instead.
