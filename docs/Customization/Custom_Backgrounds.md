# Custom Backgrounds

If you have a character backstory idea that does not correspond to a pre-existing background, you can design one for yourself. They simply require a description in a few sentences that determines the scope of what that type of character has done in their past, and what limits their knowledge and contacts skills. Then, simply pick any two skills to receive a +1 bonus.

If desired additional details unique to your character may be provided as you see fit. However, mechanically the background itself is limited to the scope that it restricts potential character knowledge and connections, and the two bonuses it provides to skills.
