# Creating a Character

The process of creating a character is a series of small steps, with each step building a distinct part of your character. No randomization is required during this process<!--, except as an [optional rule](/Extended_Systems/Randomized_Character)-->.

## Archetype

Your *archetype* is the core that a character is built from and acts as a starting position, rather than a strict limitation.

## Stats

### Attributes

Each character will start with two *good* attributes and two *weak* attributes. Good attributes have a value of d6, while weak attributes have a value of d4. If your class requires one or more attributes, you must assign those attributes as good.

### Resources

Each resource is calculated by finding the maximum value of a corresponding attribute.

##### Table: Resource Calculations
| Stat | Calculation |
|:-|:-|
| Health (HP) | 6 + Maximum STR |
| Endurance (ED) | 6 + Maximum RES |
| Stamina (ST) | 6 + Maximum DEX |
| Focus (FC) | 6 + Maximum INT |

> ***Example***

### Defences

Each defence stat is a combination of your *passive resolve* and another attribute's passive value. As a reminder, the passive value of a stat is equal to half of its maximum roll.

### Speed

Your speed is a measurement in *meters* of how fast your character can move in a *single action* (2 seconds). <!--Normally, only the base speed matters. However, other speeds can be calculated if necessary.-->

|  | Calculation |
|:-|:-|
| Speed | Size + Passive Dexterity + Passive Agility + Running Proficiency |
<!--| Long Jump | (Size + Passive Strength + Passive Athletics + Jumping Proficiency) / 3 |
| Vertical Climb | (Size + Passive Strength + Passive Athletics + Climbing Proficiency) / 4 |

### Motivation

A character's *motivation* is their primary driving force for why they make their decisions. It should be describable in a couple sentences. Motivations should be capable of roughly answering the following questions:

* What does this character want?
* Why does this character want that?
* How does this character achieve that?

> ***Example***  
> ?

Ultimately, a character's motivation will be a source of both conflict and cooperation, as characters will need to make decisions that full their motivations while trying to navigate the conflicting motivations of others.

### Ambition

A character's *ambition* is a long term goal that the character is working toward. These are typically circumstantial or character developmental goals. They can involve specific actions, places, objects, or even other characters. Ambitions do not need to be related to a character's motivation and may instead be designed to fit the current setting.

When a character's ambition has been fulfilled it is usually replaced with a new ambition. Alternatively, this can be a good opportunity to retire a character and start another.

# Creating a Character

The process of creating a character is a series of small steps, with each step building a distinct part of your character. Generally the process starts with broad decisions then leads to finer decisions.

As a reminder, whenever you assign any stat or skill a dice value, it does not mean to roll those dice. Instead it means that you assign it the dice value itself. This represents what you roll when you use that stat or skill.

## Archetype, Background, and Ancestry

Archetypes and backgrounds get you on the path to building a character with a strong theme, but they do not limit what your character can become. Essentially they are titles that provide you with some benefits and determine your starting skills and abilities. Archetypes are the strongest aspect of your character's theming as they represent where you are now as a character. In contrast, backgrounds describe who your character was in the past. Ancestries detail the type of people that they come from, which can be either a broad or specific group of people.

Make sure to ask your Game Master if any archetypes, backgrounds, or ancestries are recommended or restricted based on the content that they have prepared for you.

#### Picking an Archetype

Each [archetype](/Features/Archetypes) starts with a description detailing what type of character they are and what types of situations they excel in.

Each skill listed in each archetype is given to your character at a starting dice value of d4. Some archetypes also list skill options, denoted as one or more skills with slashes between them. You will choose only one of these skills to obtain. For example: Fighters start with one of the Archery, Finesse, or Martial skills as an option, and all of the Athletics, Charisma, Medicine, and Perception skills. If any of these skills also require you to choose a specialization, that choice is made during this step (such as a combat or power skill).

Next the archetype will list if it provides any [maneuvers](/Features/Maneuvers) or [powers](/Features/Powers) from any of its relevant combat and power skills. You may pick any maneuver or power from their respective lists so long as you meet the requirements (such as specialization) of those abilities. For example: Wizards start with one wizardry spell power. First you will choose your wizardry specialization as listed in the skill, then you will choose one spell power available to that specialization. Because we are a new character, this is necessarily limited to only tier 1 (lesser) powers. Maneuvers are not limited by tiers.

After maneuvers and powers, archetypes list their provided [talents](/Features/Talents) as additional abilities. Very few talents also require choices, but if they do they are also made during this step.

Archetypes will also list an attribute requirement. We will not fulfill the requirements during this step, but we should at least make a note of it.

#### Picking a Background

Similar to archetypes, [backgrounds](/Features/Backgrounds) start with a description of what type of character they are. Backgrounds in this way act as an additional layer of character history, detailing who your character was before they became your chosen archetype. This history limits who and what your character can know with the contacts and knowledge skills.

Each background provides a small benefit as a +1 bonus to two different skills. You receive this bonus even if you do not get that skill from your archetype.

#### Picking an Ancestry

[Ancestries](/Features/Ancestries) are widely encompassing of identity, culture, or heritage, with each listing providing a brief description detailing the general nature of those type of characters. Each ancestry has several unique abilities along with a few general stats like size and modifiers to one or more attributes. Keep a note of the modifiers to attributes until they are determined in the next step.

The size of an ancestry is an important quality determining overall effectiveness of strength and relative dexterity compared to other creatures but it also is a rough guideline for the measurements of a character. The size table below lists examples of creatures at each size category to help create a frame of reference to understand exactly how big a size really is. Most ancestries will likely be of a medium size (4).

##### Table: Size Details
| Size | Size Name | Examples |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| 1 | Miniature | Crow, Garden Snake, Mouse, Rabbit, Squirrel |
| 2 | Tiny | Badger, Cat, Eagle, Fox, Racoon, Viper |

-->

By default all characters are able to speak the language *Common* which is used as a short-hand for a language everyone shares to simplify interactions between characters. In settings with more complex linguistic interactions the Game Master may require (and provide) other language options which characters may pick instead. Some ancestries may also provide access to additional starting languages.

## Stats

Stats are primarily numerical properties of a character, most of which are derived from your attributes. You will get to choose the distribution among your attributes, which will allow you to calculate the rest of your stats.

### Attributes

The four attributes of *strength*, *dexterity*, *intelligence*, and *resolve* each influence different stats and skills. Among your attributes you will choose two of them to be *good* and two of them to be *weak*. The stats that are assigned a value of good become a d6, while the ones that are assigned a value of weak become a d4. The maximum value that attribute can roll (including any bonuses from your ancestry) will be used to meet any attribute requirements from your chosen archetype or talent choices in the future.

Each archetype will have one or more relevant attributes listed which are both a requirement for that archetype and an indicator of what types of skills and abilities the archetype will be good at using. Each required attribute must have a maxmimum value of 5 or more. For example: With an attribute of a d4+1 (maximum of 5) or a d6 (maximum of 6) you would meet this requirement but just a d4 (maximum of 4) would not.

### Resources

Characters have four resources of *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, with each being equal to the maximum value of their related attributes. For example: Your health is equal to your maximum strength, and if you have a strength of d6+1 then you would have a health of 7.

##### Table: Resource Stats
| Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Health (HP) | Maximum STR |
| Endurance (ED) | Maximum RES |
| Stamina (ST) | Maximum DEX |
| Focus (FP) | Maximum INT |

If your ancestry also has the ability called *grit*, then each of those resources are also increased by an additional 1.

### Defenses

The are four defensive stats of *fortitude*, *reflexes*, *willpower*, and *deflection*, with each relying on the passive values of your attributes. As a reminder, the passive value of a stat is equal to half of its maximum roll, plus or minus any modifiers. For example: With a resolve of d6+1, you would have a passive value of 3 plus 1 for a total of 4.

Each defensive stat is a combination of passive resolve and another passive value as demonstrated by the following table. For example: Fortitude is equal to your passive resolve and passive strength. With a resolve of d6 and a strength of d6+1, you would have a fortitude of 7.

##### Table: Defensive Stats
| Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Fortitude (FORT) | Passive RES + Passive STR |
| Reflexes (REFL) | Passive RES + Passive DEX |
| Willpower (WILL) | Passive RES + Passive INT |
| Deflection (DEFL) | Passive RES + Armour Rating |

Deflection is a special exception of the defensive stats. It relies on the passive value of only one of your attributes but it is also affected by the armour rating from any armour that you equip. For example: If you were wearing some leather armour which has an armour rating of 2, if you also have a resolve of d6, then the total value of your deflection would be 5.

### Speed

Your speed determines how many meters your character can move every 2 seconds (or one action during an encounter). It is determined by taking the size of your character plus 2 with some ancestries providing an additional bonus. For example: If your character was medium sized (4), then your speed would be 6m. If your ancestry was fast, then you would add an additional 1 for a total of 7m.

## Personalization

The most important defining feature of a character is their personality. What makes your character different? What makes your character worth playing? What about your character allows you to explore the world in unique way? Not every character needs to be completely novel but understanding who your character is supposed to be can help you and other players understand how they fit into the game world.

### Motivation

A character's motivation is the primary driving force for why characters make their decisions. It can be described in a few sentences or less. Ultimately it will be a source of both conflict and cooperation as characters will need to make decisions that fulfill their motivations which can sometimes be in contrast to the motivations of others.

Motivations must answer two questions:

* What does the character want?
* Why does the character want that?

For example: Your character could desire wealth because they want to retire living the life they believe they deserve.

Optionally, additional details can be provided to help explain these answers.

For example: They might also seek to provide that lifestyle to others living in poverty because they believe nobody deserves to live in poverty.

### Ambition

A character's ambition is a long term goal that the character is working toward. Ambitions are typically circumstantial or character developmental goals. They can involve specific actions, places, objects, or even other characters. Ambitions do not need to be related to a character's motivation and may even be designed to match the current story of the game you are playing.

For example: Your character could desire to find their missing parents. They desire a sense of family or at the very least closure and will go through any ordeal to find their parents or what discover has happened to them.

When a character's ambition has been fulfilled they are often replace with a new one. Alternatively, characters can be retired when they fulfill their ambition as a natural way to transition characters out of a game and to start new characters.

### Traits

?

## Equipment

Items held by your character are either carried in your inventory's item slots or equipped into one of your equipment item slots. The collective weight of items is not tracked but individually heavy items may be difficult to carry if your character is not very strong or athletic.

#### Item Slots

A single item slot can contain either a single item which can be held comfortably with one hand or a collection of small items which can be held inside one hand or a pocket. Objects which are too large to comfortably hold in a single hand must instead take up multiple item slots. Typically items that require two hands take two slots and items that must be held in the arms take three slots. Items larger than three or four slots are generally too large to hold inside item slots but can instead be carried on the body in place of a backpack.

<!--
Default item slots = 2 + capacity from items
The 2 is from hands

Default 

Encumbrance
Capacity
Limit
Maximum Capacity
Light Capacity
-->

The default number of item slots available for characters to carry items is equal to that character's size. If characters want to carry more items, they must wear a bag. Bags allow characters to carry more items based on their passive strength and passive athletics up to the bag's *capacity limit*. For example: Satchels have a capacity limit of 8. If both your strength and athletics are a d6+1 (both with a passive value of 4 combined totalling 8), then the bag would provide 8 additional item slots. If your strength or athletics were any higher, then the bag would not provide any more slots because the limit of the bag has already been reached.

Some bags also provide a bonus number of slots in addition to their capacity limit. These bonus slots are not counted against the capacity limit. For example: Satchels also provide a bonus +1 item slot. This makes them a valuable upgrade even if you have not reached their capacity limit.

All items at most occupy one item slot, but some items which are smaller can stack together into a single item slot. Items that can stack together into a single slot will list their quantity in brackets after the item name. The price of those items account for the entire stack.

#### Starting Equipment

Each character starts with 100 currency to spend on items. Each coin or paper bill that represents your currency is a separate item, but up to 100 coins and bills can stack together into a single slot.

If you do not want to manually purchase your starting equipment, your archetype will list some recommended item loadouts which you may start with instead of the normal 100 currency.

#### Armour

?

#### Item Weight

All items and objects have a weight and your ability to carry or move that object is limited by your strength and athletics. Most things that exist will be light enough that keeping track of their weight is unnecessary. This means characters can carry a wide range of both heavy and light things as the collective weight of items does not need to be tracked. However, if a character is carrying a number of large or heavy objects beyond what is reasonable then the Game Master may decide it is not possible.

Characters have a *weight score* which is equal to the combined value of their maximum strength and maximum athletics. Characters also have a *size multiplier* which is determined by their size (according to the table below).

<!-- Size Multiplier = (Size * Size) / 10 -->
<!--OLD
##### Table: Size Multipliers
| Size | Size Name | Size<br/>Multiplier |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| 1 | Very Tiny | 0.1 |
| 2 | Tiny | 0.4 |
| 3 | Very Small | 0.9 |
| 4 | Small | 1.6 |
| 5 | Medium | 2.5 |
| 6 | Large | 3.6 |
| 7 | Very Large | 4.9 |
| 8 | Huge | 6.4 |
| 9 | Very Huge | 8.1 |
| 10 | Gigantic | 10 |
| 11 | Very Gigantic | 12.1 |
| 12 | Enormous | 14.4 |
| 13 | Very Enormous | 16.9 |
| 14 | Massive | 19.6 |
| 15 | Very Massive | 22.5 |
| 16 | Tremendous | 25.6 |
| 17 | Very Tremendous | 28.9 |
| 18 | Colossal | 32.4 |
| 19 | Very Colossal | 36.1 |
| 20 | Titanic | 40 |
-->

Characters also have a *weight threshold* which is the lightest object you can carry that requires an athletics check to carry. It is equal to your weight score multiplied by your size multiplier. For example: A medium sized (5) character with a strength of d6+1 and an athletics of d4 would have a weight score of 11 and a size multiplier of 2.5. Multiplied together would give a value of 27.5, meaning any objects which weight 27.5kg or more require an athletics skill check to carry or move.

From here we can calculate the character's *weight check* value, which is just half of their weight threshold. When a character needs to lift a heavy object they divide the weight of the object (in kilograms) by their weight check value, rounding up, to get the difficulty.

<!--The heaviest object that a character can carry is determined by the maximum roll you can make with an athletics check. The formula for this is: your weight score squared, multiplied by your size multiplier, divided by 2. For example: The previously mentioned character with a weight score of 11 and a size multipler of 2.5 could lift at most an object weighing 151.25kg.-->

<!--For objects with a weight anywhere in between your minimum and maximum ranges, divide the weight of the object by your weight score, divide it by your size multiplier, multiply it by 2, then round it up to find the difficulty value.-->
