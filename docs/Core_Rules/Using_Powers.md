## Powers

Powers are associated with *supernatural skills*, require spending a resource like *stamina* or *focus*, and must be individually learned before they can be used. They can only be learned by characters with both a matching skill *and* proficiency. Powers are separated into *tiers* and each tier requires a specific rank of a skill and proficiency before they can be learned.

##### Table: Power Tiers
| Tier | Name | Skill | Proficiency |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Basic | d4 | +1 |
| 2 | Intermediate | d8 | +2 |
| 3 | Advanced | d12 | +3 |

Powers can only be used with the specific skill that they were learned for. In order to use them with a different skill, they must be learned again for the other skill. Powers do not need to be learned again to be used with the same skill but different proficiency.

Each of the supernatural skills that provide access to powers use them in different ways. Some of them may require that you spend *stamina* while others might require *focus*. Some of these skills might describe the use of those powers as *magical* while some might describe them as *nonmagical*. In any case, they generally follow the same steps:

* Wait for the complete action time
* Pay a resource cost based on their skill and tier
* Make a test with a listed skill and proficiency
* Compare that test to the power's difficulty based on its tier
* Apply the effect of the power based on the test

All manuevers require a test to determine the degree of their effect and many of these are made as contests against other characters.

### Power Tiers

The type of resource used is determined by the skill providing the power, while the amount of that resource is determined by the power's tier. In order to successfully use a power, the test made to use them must also beat a difficulty based on their tier.

##### Table: Power Tiers
| Tier | Name | Cost | Difficulty |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Basic | 1 | 3 (Easy) |
| 2 | Intermediate | 2 | 6 (Moderate) |
| 3 | Advanced | 3 | 9 (Hard) |

Powers get a -3 penalty for each power made before it during the same round. This is known as the *multiple power penalty*. Typically this only occurs in combat.

### Powers as Attacks




Many powers allow you to make attacks that deliver additional effects. Attacks are made this way by using the result of the test for that power if it is successful as the roll for your attack.

Attacks made this way are made as normal then provide an additional effect if they hit their target. When they do, you compare the result of your combat test from your attack against a specified defence from that target. If that also succeeds, you apply the additional effect. No additional roll is required unless the maneuver specifies multiple tests.

Attacks made by maneuvers are also subject to the *multiple attack penalty*. This means that they receive a -3 penalty for each attack made before it during the same round. Typically this only occurs in combat.
