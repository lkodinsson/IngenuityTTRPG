## Conditions

Occasionally characters suffer effects from attacks, traps, or special abilities. These types of effects are called *conditions*.

##### Table: Conditions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Bleeding | Taking physical damage each turn |
| Blinded | Provides disadvantage to all actions that require a target |
| Bloodied | The character has taken damage to their health |
| Burning | Taking fire damage each turn |
| Cover | Hiding behind cover. Provides disadvantage to ranged attackers |
| Crippled | Movement speed reduced by half |
| Encumbered | Disadvantage to use strength and dexterity, halved movement speed |
| Harmed | The character has lost at least half of their endurance |
| Overencumbered | Like encumbered, but cannot move |
| Poison | Losing health each turn |
| Prone | On the ground. Provides disadvantage to ranged attackers and advantage to melee attackers |
| Sickness | Gives a penalty to all tests, can cause loss of health |
| Stunned | Lose an action at the start of next turn. Interrupts actions and breaks concentration |
| Unconscious | Become prone when you become unconscious. Unable to take any actions |

By default, conditions are temporary and a character cannot have multiple instances of the same condition unless otherwise specified. Usually this means that the newest or most powerful instance of a condition takes precedence. Normally when a condition is applied, it will specify a duration or a circumstance that allows the condition to expire. If it does not, then it is up to the discretion of the game master.

## Recovery

During your adventures you may find yourself low on your resources. In order to recover them you will need to take either a *break* or a *rest*.

### Breaks

A break is a short amount of time spent not performing any strenuous activities. Whenever you go to relax, meditate, or make simple preparations over a period of about thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a break.

After a successful break, each of your *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, each recover by half of their maximum.

> ***Example***  
> After taking a break, if your maximum endurance is 8, then you will recover 4 endurance.

Additionally, breaks may contain a single simple activity such as performing research or crafting an item. The task in question must be easy (difficulty value of 3 or less), and the time required for the break is extended to require at least two hours.

> ***Example***  
> Justinia decides to visit the local library to read up on books about the occult.
> She spends several hours there reading books to discover clues.
> The singular task was both simple and easy, so she was able to recover some focus that she spent earlier in the session.

Breaks can only be taken up to *two* times in between each rest.

### Rests

A rest is a large amount of time usually spent sleeping for approximately eight hours.

After a successful rest, each of your *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, each recover an amount equal to their maximum. Additionally, *health* recovers by exactly 1 and any special abilities that can be used a number of times per rest recover all of their uses.

> ***Example***  
> Haldir sets up camp and sleeps for the night.
> When he awakens, he recovers all of his endurance, stamina, and focus, as well as 1 point of health since he was injured during the previous day.
> Since he also used his *second wind* talent, it recovers its per day use.

If rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered an *incomplete rest* and only half of the normal amount of endurance, stamina, and focus are recovered. The rest may be resumed within a couple hours to properly rest and recover all of the remaining resources.

> ***Example***  
> Haldir sets up camp and sleeps for the night.
> He awakens in the middle of the night to a wolf eating his food supplies.
> He recovers only half of his endurance, stamina, and focus. He does not recover any health or ability uses.
> If he can deal with the wolf and return to sleep soon, then he will be able to recover the rest of his resources.

Rests can only be taken up to once each day (usually at night).

Tracking [exhaustion](/Extended_Systems/Advanced_Ailments#fatigue) for sleepless night is a recommended but optional rule.

### Fate

Unlike other resources, fate does *not* recover during a rest or a break. Instead, characters gain 1 fate at the beginning of each game session. Spend them *wisely*.

Characters cannot have more than 3 fate at one time. If a character already has 3 fate when they gain another, then they gain zero fate instead.
