Whenever you attempt a task and success is not guaranteed, then you will need to make a *test*. To do so, you will roll a relevant *attribute* and *skill*, add any one relevant *proficiency*, then compare your result to a secretly determined *difficulty value*. In order to succeed at a task, the result of a test must meet or exceed the difficulty of the task.

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty | Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Trivial |
| 3 | Easy |
| 6 | Moderate |
| 9 | Hard |
| 12 | Challenging |
| 15 | Ambitious |
| 18 | Absurd |
| 21 | Improbable |
| 24 | Unbelievable |

> ***Example***  
> Fabian attempts to pick a locked door.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *dexterity* and *handling* for this test.
> They also notice that Fabian has the *sleight* proficiency, which they can use for this task.
> With a dexterity of d6, a handling of d4, and a sleight of +1, Fabian rolls d6+d4+1.
> The test results in a value of 7, which the game master determines is enough to succeed at the task.

All characters can perform *any* test, even if they are untrained and nonproficient. If a character is lacking in either a skill and/or proficiency, then they will perform that test using whatever they have.

> ***Example***  
> Priscilla attempts to climb a single story wall using a rope and grappling hook.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics* for this test.
> However, Priscilla does not have athletics or any relevant proficiency.
> With only a strength of d4, Priscilla rolls a d4.
> The test results in a value of 3. The game master determines that in spite of lacking both athletics and a relevant proficiency, because they used climbing tools the task was easy and they succeed at the task.

Typically, tasks of a trivial nature never require tests. However, for sufficiently proficient characters, even more difficult tasks may eventually become trivial. With a sufficiently high enough bonus from a proficiency, the lowest possible roll can eventually catch up to some difficulty values.

> ***Example***  
> Over time Fabian improves his stats and attempts a familiar task: picking a locked door.
> The game master notices that he has a d6 in handling and has a +4 in sleight.
> The lowest possible roll that Fabian can achieve is a 6.
> The difficulty to pick the lock was also a 6, so the game master decides that he doesn't need to roll any dice to determine the outcome of the test.

## Assists

In situations where only one character can perform the task but other characters still want to help, they may instead assist the character performing the task. To do so, they must perform the exact same test using the same attribute, skill, and proficiency. This provides a bonus to that character's test based on the highest threshold that the assisting character's roll meets or exceeds.

##### Table: Assist Thresholds
| <nobr>Assist Roll</nobr><br/>Threshold | Assist Bonus |
|:-:|:-:|
| 6 (Moderate) | +1 |
| 12 (Challenging) | +2 |
| 18 (Absurd) | +3 |
| 24 (Unbelievable) | +4 |

> ***Example***  
> ?

If multiple characters provide assistance simultaneously, use only the highest assist bonus provided from those characters.

## Contests

When two characters are making tests against each other, this is called a *contest*. Usually this means that one character is setting the difficulty for the other. These types of contests resolve the same way as normal tests.

> ***Example***  
> Markos is sneaking around the palace and the guards are on high alert.
> When Markos makes his test for stealth, the guards will make a test to search for intruders.
> In this way, the guards are setting the difficulty for Markos' stealth test.

In circumstances where characters are performing the same activity against each other, they are both setting the difficulty for each other. Normally when performing a test you must meet or exceed the difficulty, but in this type of circumstance one of the characters must *exceed* the other.

> ***Example***  
> Arnbjorg and Siegmund engage in an arm wrestle.
> The game master determines that to perform this test they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics*.
> They also notice that Arnbjorg has the *lifting* proficiency, which they can use for this task.
> They both roll strength and athletics, and Arnbjorg adds their lifting proficiency as a bonus.
> Arnbjorg rolls an 11 while Siegmund rolls an 8.
> Arnbjorg beats Siegmund at the arm wrestle.

Tests like this usually repeat on a tie until one character beats the other, or as a tug-of-war until one side successively beats the other.

### Size Difference

If there is a difference in size between two characters during a contest, the result of the test may be modified by the difference in size depending on the task. Typically this occurs for tasks that involve physical activites using *strength* or *dexterity*, such as trying to push or catch another creature. 

> ***Example***  
> Ursula is trying to catch a mouse.
> Because Ursula is medium sized (4) and the mouse is miniature sized (1), she is larger by a difference of 3.
> When she rolls for the contest to catch the mouse, she will treat the mouse's roll as increased by 3.

## Passive Tests

Sometimes when characters interact with each other or the environment, some outcomes can be determined automatically by making a *passive test* using certain stats as a difficulty value. These stats are calculated using *passive values* from some of your other stats.

> ***Example***  
> Siegmund decides to punch Arnbjorg, making a test rolling his *strength* and his *combat* skill.
> In order to hit Arnbjorg, he must meet or exceed Arnbjorg's *evasion*.
> His evasion is calculated from his passive *resolve*, passive *dexterity*, and *dodge* proficiency.
> Arnbjorg does not need to roll to avoid being hit.

Sometimes these passive values also act like an automatic test result instead of a difficulty value.

> ***Example***  
> The players enter an area where a small creature is hiding in a bush nearby.
> Rather than requiring the players make a test (revealing that something is hidden), the game master will compare the *passive perception* of their characters against the difficulty to spot the creature.

<!--## Defence Tests

When a passive test fails that involves a *defence* stat, players may pay *stamina* or *focus* to make a *defence test* to try again to prevent any negative effects.

##### Table: Defence Tests
| Stat | Cost | Test |
|:-|:-:|:-|
| Constitution | 1 ST | Strength (Attribute) + Athletics (Skill) + Fortitude (Proficiency) |
| Evasion | 1 ST | Dexterity (Attribute) + Agility (Skill) + Dodge (Proficiency) |
| Willpower | 1 FC | Intelligence (Attribute) + Insight (Skill) + Resistance (Proficiency) |

> ***Example***  
> Gundahar walks into a room, which begins to fill with *poisonous spores*.
> The difficulty to prevent the poison is greater than their *fortitude*, so they will become poisoned.
> The player controlling Gundahar wants to prevent this, so they attempt a *defence test*.
> Since the poison is being compared to their fortitude, they will need to spend 1 *stamina*, then roll their *strength*, plus their *athletics* skill, plus their *resilience* proficiency.

If this defence test fails, you may not try again by spending more resources.-->

## Luck

In addition to the dice you roll during a test, you will also roll a d20 called the *luck die*. If the luck die results in a value of *20 or greater*, then you receive a +3 to the result of your roll for that test. Do not add the value on your luck die directly to your test roll. This does not guarantee success. Do not roll the luck die for passive tests.

> ***Example***  
> Milo attempts to leap over a 3m pit.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *dexterity* and *agility* for this test.
> They also notice that Milo has the *jumping* proficiency, which they can use for this task.
> With a dexterity of d6, an agility of d4, and a jumping of +1, Milo rolls d6+d4+1, and the d20 *luck die*.
> Milo rolls a 9 for his test and rolls a 20 on his luck die. He adds a +3 to his roll, resulting in a 12 for the test.
> The game master determines that 12 is more than enough to succeed at the task.

In rare circumstances where only luck is a factor, you may instead be asked to make a *luck test*. If you do, roll the luck die on its own instead of making a normal test.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Circumstance, clever role-playing, or the use of one of your abilities may provide you with *advantage*. For each source of advantage that you have while performing a test, you may reroll one die of your choice and you may keep the better result.

Conversely, you may sometimes find yourself with *disadvantage*. If you do, you must instead reroll one die with the greatest result and you *must* keep the worse result.

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, then it would require an equal amount of disadvantage to completely cancel out.

Neither advantage or disadvantage can be used to reroll the luck die.

## Failure

When a test is performed and does not meet or exceed the difficulty, the test *fails* and the desired outcome is not achieved. However, this does not necessarily result in a dead end or that nothing happens. There may instead be additional consequences for failure, such as escalating risk. In this way, failure is more often a change of circumstances than it is a dead end. Failure should be viewed more as an opportunity to push your luck or explore alternate decisions.

> ***Example***  
> Priscilla attempts to climb the side of a mansion to the third floor using a rope and grappling hook.
> The game master determines that they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics* for this test.
> However, Priscilla does not have athletics or any relevant proficiency.
> With only a strength of d4, Priscilla rolls a d4.
> The test results in a value of 2. Unfortunately, this is well below what the game master has determined is necessary to reach the third floor. Priscilla fails her test.

When a test is failed the player usually has three options:

* Escalate the task
* Modify the task
* Abandon the task

When completing the task is greatly desired, it may be escalated. In this case, the risk of failure is increased as a cost to perform the task again. At most a task may be escalated twice. This means that the same task may only be performed three times in a row. The first failure is usually safe, the second failure has a small risk, and the third failure a serious risk.

> ***Example***  
> Priscilla wants to keep climbing the mansion's walls in spite of her lack of strength. She needs to get inside.
> The game master determines that she may keep trying to climb up the wall, but with the added risk that failure may result in falling and taking damage.

Instead of escalating a task, it may instead be modified. This means to change the goal of the task, either to something easier or to a different result entirely.

> ***Example***  
> Priscilla doesn't want to risk taking any damage climbing to the third floor.
> Instead she decides to change her target to only the second floor.
> The game master determines this to be an easier task.

> ***Example***  
> Fabian attempts to pry a window open, but fails to break in.
> Instead of escalating the task and possibly breaking his tools or jamming the window, he decides to simply break it open.
> The game master determines this to be much easier but would make a loud noise.

When all else fails, the test must be abandoned. At this point the task can no longer be attempted or completed. Depending on the task this may often exclude others from attempting it as well. This is to be expected if the task needed to be abandoned after being previously escalated.

> ***Example***  
> Fabian attempts to pick a lock but the lock is very complicated.
> Fabian escalates twice, failing each time.
> The game master determines that the lock becomes completely jammed as a result.
> None of the characters may continue to attempt to pick the lock.

This outcome is usually rare unless the task itself was convincingly unlikely from the beginning. This is a signal to try alternative strategies.

## Time

Performing tasks also requires time. The amount of time required can be just a few seconds, to 10 minutes, to a whole hour. The more tasks that are attempted, the more time that is spent. As time passes, the current situation will often advance or change, presenting new and sometimes more difficult challenges for the players.

> ***Example***  
> The players enter a new room filled with lots of things to interact with and information to collect.
> For each task the players perform while in the room, time passes.
> Whenever certain amounts of time pass, the game master may perform hidden tests to determine if new dangers approach the players.
