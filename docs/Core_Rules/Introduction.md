# Introduction

Ingenuity shares many features with other role-playing systems: you control a *character*, your character has *stats* represented by numbers and dice, and special *abilities* your character can perform. As you progress you collect *experience points* but you do not gain levels by collecting experience like most other systems. Instead, you spend your experience points to upgrade your character and buy new abilities directly.

## Playing the Game

In a typical game session the *game master* will describe the *situation* then the players will describe the *actions* that their characters take. This will go back and forth as the game master asks the players to roll dice, describes the outcome of player actions, and presents new situations. It is important as a player to focus on exploring the game as your character more than always declaring the exact game actions that you intend to use.

> ***Example***
> **GM:** As you approach the campfire, you spot a goblin roasting some food. They have their back turned toward you.
> **Player:** I sneak up close to the goblin, intending to deliver a sneak attack if they are alone.
> **GM:** Make a test for Dexterity + Agility + Stealth.
> **Player:** Oof. I rolled a 2...
> **GM:** Unfortunately, you step on a branch as you approach, alerting the goblin. They panic and call out, "who goes there?!" Fortunately, they do not yet see you...

Not every action requires dice rolling and in some cases not even any rules. If the players are agreed on the fiction and the results, then the rules need not apply. Making rolls are primarily for risk, uncertainty, and/or tension. The most important rule is that the rest of the rules exist to serve the fiction.

#### Archetypes

Each character is made out of various parts which define who that character is, what they do, what they know, and where they come from. Characters have a class which provide the bulk of what they are capable of, a background which describes their history, and an ancestry which describes their people and culture.

#### Customization

When you create a character you also get to customize some unique features of that character. Traits are customizable abilities that only your character can perform, motivations are the reason your character takes any actions at all, and ambitions are long term goals that your character seeks to achieve. Together these features work to provide a unique play experience even if your character shares the same core building blocks as another character.

#### Adventures and Rewards

The goal of an adventure is to provide both risks and opportunities for characters to express themselves by rising to the challenges presented. In addition to the various material rewards like treasures and special items, acting according to your character's motivation and achieving your character's ambitions can provide you with increased experience and therefore character growth.

#### Failure as Opportunity

In circumstances where the dice fail to bring the results necessary for the players to achieve their goals, players are not always presented with a dead end. Players and game masters are encouraged to explore situations of escalating risk and changing circumstances to explore new opportunities to find success. This helps keep a degree of exploration and progress through a scene even when everything does not go to plan.

## Dice and Math

Ingenuity uses standard [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation). Whenever you need to perform any game action that requires rolling dice, you will add any numbers rolled together to get your result.

#### Passive Values

Any value that is represented by dice also has what is called a *passive value*. This value is always slightly below your average roll, making it a useful tool for estimating your results. It is calculated by dividing the maximum value of the dice in half, plus or minus any additional modifiers.

> ***Example***  
> If you have a stat with a value of d6, then its passive value would be 6 divided by 2, totalling 3.
> If that stat also has an additional modifier of +1, then its passive value would increase from 3 to 4.

#### Rounding

If at any point during the game you are required to divide any numbers, the resulting number is always rounded up unless otherwise specified.
