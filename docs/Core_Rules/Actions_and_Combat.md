## Actions

Any task or active ability that a character uses can be considered a type of action. In combat players have a limited amount that they can use on their turn. Outside of combat players can perform whatever actions that fit the scene. In addition to the standard tasks which involve describing character behaviour and performing tests, there are special abilities called *maneuvers* and *powers* which provide more powerful special effects.

Even actions that are typically used in combat, like *defensive actions*, can also be used outside of combat if the context of the scene is appropriate.

## Combat

When a group of characters intends harm on another group of characters, the situation turns into *combat*. Usually this occurs because each team is focused on conflicting *objectives* and combat is a method of stopping opposing teams from interfering with that objective.

Participants in combat are separated into *teams*. Teams and their *members* will take turns performing actions until one team remains or one team completes their objective. In rare situations, a team's objective may change from one round of combat to another.

### Initiative and Rounds

The *team* in a combat encounter with the highest *initiative* will go first, followed by each other team with the next highest initiative. On a tie, the team containing the players goes first. A team's initiative is equal to the highest *reflexes* that any one member of that team has.

> ***Example***  
> The players accidentally alert some guards who sound the alarm and begin to attack.
> On the player's team, Clementine has the highest reflexes of 4, so their team has an initiative of 4.
> On the guard's team, they all have a reflexes of 4, so their team also has an initiative of 4.
> Since both teams have the same initiative, the player's team will go first.

Once team order has been determined, the combat will enter into *rounds*. Each round represents about *six seconds* in the game world, meaning there are about *ten rounds* in *one minute*. During each round, each participant in the combat will each get *one turn*. Each team will select one member to take a turn, and then pass to the next team, until each team has given all of their members a turn. Once this happens, the next round begins.

> ***Example***  
> The players go first, and they decide to let Roland take the first turn so he can get into a good position.
> Next, the guards will decide to let their captain take a turn so he can rally the troops.
> Then the players will go again, this time selecting Clementine who attacks one of the guards.
> Then the guards will go again, selecting a guard who will move to and then attack Roland.
> Teams will continue to alternate until all participants have taken their turns.
> The round will then end and the next round will begin, repeating the process.

During new rounds, players may decide to take their turns in a different order than in a previous round.

If one team has much fewer members than another team, then they simply run out of members to give turns to. This means that any remaining teams with members may still continue to assign turns. Try not to get outnumbered.

> ***Example***  
> During a round the players manage to defeat a few of the guards, resulting in lopsided teams of four players versus two guards.
> On a future round, once both the players and the guards have taken two turns each, only the players will have members on their team left to act.
> Since this is the case, each of them may simply take their turns in any order they like as there are no other teams with remaining members to give turns to.

If at any time a character becomes unable to act (such as by becoming unconscious), they lose the ability to take a turn. When they regain consciousness, they may take their turn at the next possible opportunity.

> ***Example***  
> During combat with the guards, one of them managed to knock Roland unconscious before he could take his turn.
> However, on Clementine's turn she managed to resuscitate Roland and return him to consciousness.
> Since a player just took a turn, it passes to the guard's team (if they have any members left to act).
> After the guards take a turn, the players may decide to give Roland the next turn.

### Surprise

Sometimes circumstances will lead a team to have the advantage of *surprise*. This can happen by using stealth or by starting combat when the opponents were not expecting it. In this case, the team with the benefit of surprise gets to take a whole round where only their team may take actions. After this round, teams will alternate taking turns as normal.

> ***Example***  
> While exploring a room the players start to make a lot of noise.
> As a result, a few goblins hear them and stealthily approach their position.
> The players fail to detect the goblins, so they catch the players by surprise.
> The goblins then proceed to all take turns as they attack the players.

During a surprise round, if there are any characters that do not have the advantage of surprise but also cannot be surprised, then they may take actions as normal even if the rest of their team cannot. In this case, the initiative of the teams are compared as normal during the surprise round instead of only when normal rounds begin.

> ***Example***  
> Thankfully, Clementine has the *danger sense* talent and cannot be surprised.
> During the surprise round, Clementine defeats one of the goblins.
> As a result, there is one less goblin attacking them during the surprise round.
> After the surprise round, normal rounds begin and each team takes their turns as normal.

### Actions in Combat

Each turn in combat, characters may take *three actions*. Since each round is considered to represent *six seconds* of time passing, each action represents *two seconds*. By default, any action you can take during a turn is considered to take *one action* unless otherwise specified. Some actions will also specify if they require you to spend additional resources like *stamina* or *focus*.

##### Table: Actions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Activity | Three actions. Perform a complex task that requires making a test |
| Attack | Make an attack against a target with an item or weapon |
| Brandish | Choose what items you are holding in your hands |
| Command | Once per turn, spend 1 focus to target an ally to take an action during your turn |
| Interact | Use an object in the immediate area such as doors and inventory items |
| Guard | End the turn but gain a +1 bonus to *all* defences and defence tests until next turn |
| Move | Once per turn, move up to your speed |
| Ready an Action | Declare any action with a trigger condition and end the turn. Prepare that action as a reaction until taken or until the next turn |
| Resuscitate | Two actions. Go prone, then make a test to return someone to consciousness |
| Seek Cover | Give ranged attackers disadvantage while behind cover until next turn |
| Sprint | If you have already moved this turn, spend 1 stamina to take another move action |
| Stand Up | Get up from being prone |
| Wait | End the turn but gain an extra reaction until next turn |

During each *round*, characters may also take up to *one reaction*. Reactions can be taken on any character's turn and are recovered at the start of each turn.

##### Table: Reactions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Block | Spend 1 stamina to use a shield to redirect incoming damage |
| Dodge | Spend 1 stamina to attempt to avoid an attack by making a test |
| Fortify | Spend 1 stamina to attempt to prevent a physical effect by making a test |
| Intercept | Spend 1 stamina to move and displace an ally replacing them as a target, then may take any defensive action as a free reaction |
| Parry | Spend 1 stamina to use an item to add to your deflection |
| Resist | Spend 1 focus to attempt to prevent a mental effect by making a test |

Actions that are longer than a single turn (more than six seconds or three actions) are called *extended actions*. Extended actions and any other action which takes more actions than you have left in a turn can be taken the same as any other action, but you must wait until the *full action time* has occurred before you can perform the effects of that action. If during a future turn you wish to abandon an action that you have already started, you may do so at no extra cost and take your turn as normal.

> ***Example***  
> During her turn, Petra *fires her crossbow* at an enemy, then decides to *seek cover*.
> Reloading her crossbow requires that she takes *two actions* but she only has *one action* remaining.
> She decides to start reloading her crossbow with her remaining action.
> On her next turn, in order to finish reloading she will need to spend her *first action* to finish reloading the crossbow before she can take any other actions.

Actions that are longer than a single turn (more than six seconds or three actions) are called *extended actions*. You may take *any* action that requires more than you have left by spending actions from future turns. However, the action will only be completed once the *full action time* has passed. You may cancel an action started this way at any time during your turn at no extra cost, and take your turn as normal.

Some actions may also be *free actions* or *free reactions*, which do not count against your action and reaction limit per turn.

##### Table: Free Actions
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Drop Item | Drop any held item onto the ground |
| Drop Prone | Become prone, giving ranged attackers disadvantage and melee attackers advantage |
| Step | Once per turn, take a 1m step instead of a move action |

### Attacks

To make an attack with a weapon, make a test using one of the *attributes* listed for that weapon, plus your *combat* skill, and any relevant *proficiency*. Compare the result against the target's *evasion*. If the test succeeds, the attack hits. Otherwise, it misses.

> ***Example***  
> Boudica attacks an enemy with her spear, which can use either strength or dexterity, and finesse or martial proficiencies.
> She chooses to make her attack test using her strength (d6), combat skill (d4), and martial proficiency (+1).
> She rolls d6+d4+1, resulting in a 6.
> The enemy has a evasion of 6, so she just hits with her attack.

The amount of damage dealt by an attack that hits is equal to the result of your test plus the weapon's damage. This damage is then reduced by the target's matching *damage reduction* to a minimum of 1. Damage is first dealt to the target's endurance, with any excess damage being dealt to the target's health.

> ***Example***  
> Boudica attacks and hits an enemy with her spear, with a test resulting in a 6.
> The damage from her spear is 4 (piercing), which she adds to her roll of 6, resulting in a total damage of 10 (piercing).
> The enemy has a physical damage reduction of 8, which is subtracted from her damage, resulting in a total damage taken of 2.

The luck die modifies an attack differently than a normal test. Instead of adding a +3 when the luck die rolls a 20 or greater, if your luck roll is greater than or equal to the weapon's critical threshold, the attack cannot miss, and it uses its critical damage instead of its normal damage.

> ***Example***  
> Boudica attacks and hits an enemy with her spear, with a test resulting in a 6.
> Additionally, her luck die rolls a 19 which is within the weapon's critical threshold of 19+.
> The critical damage from her spear is 8 (piercing), which she adds to her roll of 6, resulting in a total damage of 14 (piercing).
> The enemy has a physical damage reduction of 8, which is subtracted from her damage, resulting in a total damage taken of 6.

If your weapon is thrown or fires a projectile and your target is within 1m of other characters, then there is a chance to hit those characters instead of your intended target. If your luck roll results in a 1 or less, then your attack randomly targets one of those adjacent characters instead.

> ***Example***  
> Agnessa attacks an enemy with her shortbow who is next to one of her allies.
> Unfortunately, her luck die rolls a 1, which results in her targeting another nearby character.
> Only her ally is nearby, so she must target her ally instead.
> She finishes the attack as normal, but with her ally as the new target.

Attacks get a -3 penalty for each attack made before it during the same round. This penalty also applies to attacks from maneuvers. This is known as the *multiple attack penalty*.

> ***Example***  
> Agnessa attempts to attack the enemy again with her shortbow.
> She makes her attack as normal, resulting in a 5, but this time with a -3 penalty because she has already attacked once during her turn, for a new result of 2.
> Unfortunately, this attack is not enough to hit her target's evasion, so she misses.

Attacks made against enemies who cannot see you or who are surrounded on two opposite sides, are made with advantage. These are known as *sneak attacks* and *flanking attacks* respectively. You do not need to be contributing to a flank to make a flanking attack (such as making a ranged attack against a flanked target). If you make an attack that is both a sneak attack and a flanking attack it will provide you with double advantage.

> ***Example***  
> Fabian sneaks up behind an enemy and attacks them with his dagger.
> Because the enemy did not see him coming, he gets advantage to his attack as a *sneak attack*.

> ***Example***  
> Agnessa attacks an enemy with her shortbow who has two of her allies nearby them, one on each side.
> Because the enemy is surrounded, she gets advantage to her attack as a *flanking attack*.

If there is a difference in size between you and the target, then treat their evasion and deflection as modified by this difference. If you are larger, treat their evasion as increased and their deflection as decreased. If you are smaller, do the opposite.

> ***Example***  
> Fabian attacks a goblin with his dagger.
> Because Fabian is medium sized (4) and the goblin is small sized (3), he is larger by a difference of 1.
> During this attack, Fabian will treat their evasion as 1 higher and their deflection as 1 lower.

### Defensive Actions

Before a character receives an attack they may decide to react with a *defensive action*, which is any reaction that allows you to *block*, *dodge*, *fortify*, *parry*, or *resist*.

#### Block

When you *block* an attack, you may use a wielded item with the block property to absorb the damage before you. If you do, the item is considered to be hit instead of you. Reduce the damage by the item's block value instead of your damage reduction, then deal the remaining damage to the item's durability to a minimum of 1. If possible, any effects that apply from being hit are dealt to the item instead. Otherwise, they cause no effect. You may decide to block after you would get hit but before you take damage.

> ***Example***  
> ?

If an item you are blocking with would be dealt damage from an attack in excess of its durability, the excess damage is dealt directly to you as though it was from a successful hit. Any effects that apply from being hit are still dealt to you as normal.

> ***Example***  
> ?

#### Dodge

When you *dodge* an attack, instead of using your evasion, make a test using your dexterity attribute, agility skill, and dodge proficiency. If your result is less than your evasion, use your evasion instead.

> ***Example***  
> Fabian is attacked but does not want to receive damage, so he attempts to dodge the attack.
> The enemy rolls to attack, resulting in a 7.
> Fabian rolls his dexterity (d6) and agility skill (d4), then adds his dodge proficiency (+1), resulting in an 8.
> If Fabian did not dodge the attack, the enemy would have beaten his evasion of 4. Instead, he manages to dodge the attack.
> After he dodges, he decides to move 1m away from the attacker, making it harder to be attacked again.

After you dodge, even if you fail, you may drop prone, seek cover, and/or move up to 1m.

#### Fortify

When you *fortify* against an effect, instead of using your constitution, make a test using your strength attribute, athletics skill, and fortitude proficiency. If your result is less than your constitution, use your constitution instead.

> ***Example***  
> ?

#### Parry

When you *parry* an attack, choose a wielded item to use for the parry. If that item has a parry value, add it to your physical deflection. If it does not, add 1 instead. <!--Parrying allows you to reduce damage to zero instead of the normal minimum of 1.--> After you parry, that item receives 1 damage to its durability.

> ***Example***  
> ?

If an item does not have a listed durability and it is made of metal, it has a durability of 10. Otherwise, it has a durability of 4. Items that are broken (have zero durability) cannot be used to block or parry.

#### Resist

When you *resist* against an effect, instead of using your willpower, make a test using your intelligence attribute, insight skill, and resistance proficiency. If your result is less than your willpower, use your willpower instead.

> ***Example***  
> ?

### Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, a trap, or by any means, they will usually take *damage*. Damage is separated into multiple categories such as *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless* damage. Most sources of damage will deal either physical or elemental damage. If a type is not specified, then it can be considered typeless damage. Normally, only physical and elemental damage can be reduced by *deflection*.

##### Table: Damage Types
| Name | Type |
|:-|:-|
| Arcane | Elemental |
| Bludgeoning | Physical |
| Cold | Elemental |
| Fire | Elemental |
| Piercing | Physical |
| Psychic | Typeless |
| Radiant | Elemental |
| Shock | Elemental |
| Slashing | Physical |
| Void | Elemental |

Damage that characters take is first dealt to their endurance. While at half of their endurance or less, they are considered to be [harmed](/Core_Rules/Conditions_and_Recovery#conditions). If damage is dealt in excess of endurance, that damage is instead dealt to health. While at less than their maximum health, they are also considered [bloodied](//Core_Rules/Conditions_and_Recovery#conditions).

> ***Example***  
> Boudica is attacked and takes 7 damage.
> With an endurance of 12, her endurance is reduced to 5.
> Because she has an amount of endurance equal or less than half of her maximum, she is also considered harmed.

When a character loses health, if their missing health is greater than their constitution, they must either become unconscious or *fortify* against a difficulty equal to their missing health to remain conscious. Fortifying in this way is still a reaction.

> ***Example***  
> Boudica is attacked again and takes 10 more damage.
> With a remaining endurance of 5, her endurance is reduced to zero, with the excess damage of 5 being dealt to her health.
> With a health of 12, her health is reduced to 7.
> Because her missing health (5) is greater than her constitution of 4, she must choose to foritfy or become unconscious.
> Boudica fortifies, spending 1 stamina, then rolls her strength (d6) and athletics (d4), then adds her fortitude proficiency (+1), resulting in a 7.
> She succeeds her test against her missing health and manages to maintain consciousness.
> Because she has any of her health missing, she is also considered bloodied.

### Death

When a character is reduced to zero health, they immediately become unconscious. If the damage they received exceeded their remaining health, then they also risk death. They may make a luck test attempting to roll a 10 or greater. If they fail, they die. If they succeed, they *cheat death*, and this number is *permanently* increased by 5.

> ***Example***  
> Boudica is attacked a final time and takes 8 more damage.
> With a remaining health of 7, her health is brought to zero, and she becomes unconscious.
> Because the damage exceeded her remaining health, she also risks death.
> She makes a luck test attempting to cheat death, but rolls a 1.
> She fails her luck test and dies.

While a character is unconscious, another character may use any nonlethal weapon to kill them instantly. This is called a *killing strike*. This requires making a test (with advantage) using the combat skill against their constitution. If it fails, then a sneak attack is made instead of causing instant death. While in combat, this requires taking the *activity* action (which takes *three actions*).

> ***Example***  
> ?

When a character is brought to zero health from damage that would exceed their remaining health and that damage is from a nonlethal source, they do not immediately risk death. Any more damage taken while at zero health, including from a nonlethal source will cause them to risk death as normal.

## Fate Actions

At any time, 1 point of *fate* may be spent to achieve any one of the following effects:

* Ask the game master any one question about the current scene, which they must answer truthfully
* Maximize a single die during a test you roll (including the luck die)
* Take an additional action during your turn in combat
* Choose one of endurance, stamina, or focus, to recover by half of their maximum
* Reduce a single source of damage taken to half (after damage reduction)
* Perform a character advancement during the current scene, reducing the experience cost to half
<!--* Prevent your character from dying at the cost of inhibiting their motivation or ambition-->

You may spend multiple fate points at the same time.
