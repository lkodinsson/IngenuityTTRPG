# Item Crafting

## Improvised Crafting

When under time pressure or with less than ideal means, certain tools and equipment can be improvised by crafting. This will involve a normal skill check to craft a single-use item for the purposes of overcoming a challenge. Items crafted in this way are typically not permanent items, but are more often alterations to the environment for the purposes of roleplaying. This can be things like cooking a meal, tying things together, troubleshooting a stereo, or setting a trap.

## Downtime Crafting

When characters are provided time in between adventures or they are travelling long distances, they can spend that time to create new items or improve their existing ones.

To craft an item you essentially need four things: *time*, *tools*, *knowledge*, and *materials*. The requirement of time is simple; if you're not doing anything else you can spend in-game time crafting. Toolkits satisfy the second requirement, but need to be of a specific type relevant to the craft. If you're making a bow and some arrows, you would need either a bowyer's toolkit or a fletching toolkit, or really just any type of specific toolkit that involves the process of making either of those items. Knowledge is character dependant; a doctor would not have relevant knowledge to craft a bow, but a ranger who lives in the wilderness and uses one regularly likely would have that knowledge. Finally there is access to materials. Crafting items is essentially the ability to purchase any item you want but at a discount determined by your crafting check. This means you either need access to a marketplace to purchase the necessary materials, or have collected those materials directly from the environment (like cutting a tree down for wood). Half of the total cost of the item is represented by materials in this way; the rest of the cost of the item is simply you spending your currency to craft that item.

### Difficulty and Time

Once the pre-crafting requirements are met the desired item can be crafted. First, we need the cost of the item, which is used to determine the difficulty and time required. According to the following table, the difficulty is determined by the greatest cost met or exceeded. For example: to craft an item which has a cost of 10, it will have a difficulty of 5, and it will take 2 hours to make.

##### Table: Item Crafting Difficulty & Time
| Item<br/>Cost | Difficulty | Time |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0+ | 1 | 8 minutes |
| 1+ | 2 | 15 minutes |
| 2+ | 3 | 30 minutes |
| 4+ | 4 | 1 hour |
| 8+ | 5 | 2 hours |
| 15+ | 6 | 4 hours |
| 30+ | 7 | 1 day |
| 60+ | 8 | 2 days |
| 125+ | 9 | 3 days |
| 250+ | 10 | 5 days |
| 500+ | 11 | 7 days |
| 1,000+ | 12 | 10 days |
| 2,000+ | 13 | 14 days |
| 4,000+ | 14 | 21 days |
| 8,000+ | 15 | 28 days |
| 15,000+ | 16 | 40 days |
| 30,000+ | 17 | 55 days |
| 60,000+ | 18 | 80 days |
| 125,000+ | 19 | 100 days |
| 250,000+ | 20 | 140 days |
| 500,000+ | 21 | 210 days |
| 1,000,000+ | 22 | 280 days |
| 2,000,000+ | 23 | 400 days |
| 4,000,000+ | 24 | 550 days |
| 8,000,000+ | 25 | 800 days |
| ... | ... | ... |
<!--| 15,000,000+ | 26 | 1000 days |
| 30,000,000+ | 27 | 1400 days |
| 60,000,000+ | 28 | 2100 days |
| 125,000,000+ | 29 | 2800 days |
| 250,000,000+ | 30 | 4000 days |
| 500,000,000+ | 31 | 5500 days |
| 1,000,000,000+ | 32 | 8000 days |
-->

Each crafting day is the equivalent of 8 hours of work.

The highest difficulty item that a character can craft is limited by their intelligence and their craft skill. The maximum difficulty is equal to passive intelligence multiplied by their passive craft skill then adding 1. For example if you have a d6+1 intelligence and a d6 in craft, that would be 4 multiplied by 3 which is 12, then plus 1 for a total of 13.

##### Table: Item Crafting Maximum Difficulty
| Dice<br/>Value | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d12+1 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| - | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| d4 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 | 15 |
| d6 | 7 | 10 | 13 | 16 | 19 | 22 |
| d8 | 9 | 13 | 17 | 21 | 25 | 29 |
| d10 | 11 | 16 | 21 | 26 | 31 | 36 |
| d12 | 13 | 19 | 25 | 31 | 37 | 43 |
| d12+1 | 15 | 22 | 29 | 36 | 43 | 50 |

### Craft Checks

Before rolling a craft check, you must have at least enough currency and materials to pay for the full value of the item. After the full amount of time required to craft has been spent, you then make a skill check using your craft skill against the item's difficulty value. The degree to which this difficulty is exceeded will determine how much of a discount is provided. You get a 2% discount for every 1 that you exceed the difficulty. Round up on any costs paid.

> ##### Crafting Example: Success
> **Item Cost:** 80  
> **Difficulty:** 8  
> **Time:** 2 days
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 10 (Success)  
> **Discount:** 4% = (10 - 8) × 2%  
> **Cost Paid:** 76.8 = 80 × 96%

If the craft check does not meet or exceed the difficulty then the craft is not failed, but only partially completed. The amount of progress made is the ratio of your result and the difficulty. In this case, you pay for whatever percentage of progress is made.

<!--"In this case, a percent of the *remaining* progress is completed at 100% of the cost (no discount)."???-->

> ##### Crafting Example: Failure
> **Item Cost:** 300  
> **Difficulty:** 10  
> **Time:** 5 days
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 2 (Failure)  
> **Progress:** 20% = 2 / 10  
> **Cost Paid:** 60 = 300 × 20%

### Resuming a Craft

To resume a previously failed craft, the remaining percentage determines the remaining cost which determines the time required, but at a difficulty determined by the original cost.

> ##### Crafting Example: Resuming a Craft
> **Item Cost:** 300  
> **Difficulty:** 10  
> **Time:** 5 days  
> **Previous Progress:** 20%
> ___
> **Progress Remaining:** 80%  
> **Cost Remaining:** 240 = 300 × 80%  
> **Time Adjusted:** 3 days (from 5 days)

If your craft roll succeeds on a resumed craft, you pay for the craft as normal but only on the remaining cost of the item. This includes the bonus discount for exceeding the difficulty value.

> ##### Crafting Example: Resumed Success
> **Item Cost:** 300  
> **Difficulty:** 10  
> **Time:** 5 days  
> **Previous Progress:** 20%
> ___
> **Progress Remaining:** 80%  
> **Cost Remaining:** 240 = 300 × 80%  
> **Time Adjusted:** 3 days (from 5 days)
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 12 (Success)  
> **Discount:** 4% = (12 - 10) × 2%  
> **Cost Paid:** 230.4 = 240 × 96%

If your craft roll fails on a resumed craft, add your new progress to the previous total and paying 100% of the cost like a normal failure.

> ##### Crafting Example: Resumed Failure
> **Item Cost:** 300  
> **Difficulty:** 10  
> **Time:** 5 days  
> **Previous Progress:** 50%
> ___
> **Progress Remaining:** 50%  
> **Cost Remaining:** 150 = 300 × 50%  
> **Time Adjusted:** 3 days (from 5 days)
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 4 (Failure)  
> **Additional Progress:** 40% = 4 / 10  
> **Total Progress:** 90% = 50% + 40%  
> **Cost Paid:** 120 = 150 × (40% / 50%) × 100%

If instead your new total progress exceeds 100%, then the craft is completed but you still pay 100% of the remaining cost.

> ##### Crafting Example: Resumed Failure into Success
> **Item Cost:** 300  
> **Difficulty:** 10  
> **Time:** 5 days  
> **Previous Progress:** 90%
> ___
> **Progress Remaining:** 10%  
> **Cost Remaining:** 30 = 300 × 10%  
> **Time Adjusted:** 1 day (from 5 days)
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 8 (Failure)  
> **Additional Progress:** 80% = 8 / 10  
> **Total Progress:** 170% = 90% + 80%  
> **Cost Paid:** 30 = 30 × 100%

### Critical Success

The luck die also plays a part in modifying your crafting results. If your luck roll results in a 20 or greater, the craft can be upgraded from a success to a critical success adding an additional 10% discount.

> ##### Crafting Example: Critical Success
> **Item Cost:** 1000  
> **Difficulty:** 12  
> **Time:** 10 days
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 17 (Success)  
> **Luck Roll:** 20 (Success -> Critical)  
> **Discount:** 20% = (17 - 12) × 2% + 10%  
> **Cost Paid:** 800 = 1000 × 80%

If you are at least proficient (d8) in craft your luck roll can also upgrade your failures to successes. In this case, you simply pay for 100% of the cost with no additional discount (you did not exceed the difficulty).

### Materials

If you don't have access to a marketplace to purchase materials directly, they can be collected or purchased in advance of a craft. Materials are usually represented as trade goods like ingots or machine parts. Those materials will cover an amount of an item's cost equal to their value up to half of the total cost of the item (before discounts). These materials are spent after the discounted cost is calculated.

> ##### Crafting Example: Success with Materials
> **Item Cost:** 150  
> **Difficulty:** 9  
> **Time:** 3 days
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 12 (Success)  
> **Discount:** 6% = (12 - 9) × 2%  
> **Material Value:** 75  
> **Cost Paid:** 66 = 150 × 94% - 75

In extreme cases if the material value is greater than the discounted cost to be paid, some materials may be left over.

> ##### Crafting Example: Critical Success with Remaining Materials
> **Item Cost:** 10  
> **Difficulty:** 5  
> **Time:** 2 hours
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 26 (Success)  
> **Luck Roll:** 20 (Success -> Critical)  
> **Discount:** 52% = (26 - 5) × 2% + 10%  
> **Material Value:** 5  
> **Cost Paid:** -0.2 = 10 × 48% - 5  
> **Remaining Materials:** 0.2

Materials that are spent in failed attempts are proportional to the progress made.

> ##### Crafting Example: Failure with Remaining Materials
> **Item Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 8  
> **Time:** 2 days
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 5 (Failure)  
> **Progress:** 63% = 5 / 8  
> **Progress Cost:** 63 = 100 × 63%  
> **Material Value:** 50  
> **Cost Paid:** 31.5 = 63 × 100% - 50 × 63%  
> **Remaining Materials:** 18.5 = 50 × 37%

Resumed crafts may only use materials proportional to the remaining cost.

> ##### Crafting Example: Resumed Success with Materials
> **Item Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 8  
> **Time:** 2 days  
> **Previous Progress:** 63%
> ___
> **Progress Remaining:** 37%  
> **Cost Remaining:** 37 = 100 × 37%  
> **Time Adjusted:** 1 day (from 2 days)
> ___
> **Craft Check:** 10 (Success)  
> **Discount:** 4% = (10 - 8) × 2%  
> **Material Value:** 18.5  
> **Cost Paid:** 17 = 37 × 96% - 18.5

### Partial Crafting

Under circumstances where there is a limited amount of time, an item may be partially crafted by spending whatever time is available. The cost and difficulty are determined as normal for the item, but the percentage of the item crafted and the cost paid are both proportional to the time spent versus the total time required.

> ##### Crafting Example: Partial Crafting
> **Item Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 8  
> **Time:** 2 days
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 1 day  
> **Proportional Progress:** 50% = (1 day / 2 days)  
> **Craft Check:** 10 (Success)  
> **Discount:** 4% = (10 - 8) × 2%  
> **Cost Paid:** 48 = 100 × 50% × 96%

If a partial craft is failed, it is the same as when a normal craft is failed but proportional to the time spent.

> ##### Crafting Example: Partial Crafting Failure
> **Item Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 8  
> **Time:** 2 days
> ___
> **Time Spent:** 1 day  
> **Proportional Progress:** 50% = (1 day / 2 days)  
> **Craft Check:** 5 (Failure)  
> **Failure Progress:** 63% = 5 / 8  
> **Total Progress:** 32% = 63% × 50%  
> **Cost Paid:** 32 = 100 × 32% × 100%

Partially completed crafts can be resumed the same as how previously failed crafts are completed; the remaining percentage of the item determines the cost and time required, but at a difficulty determined by the original cost. Resuming a craft can also be done partially.

## Additional Crafting Methods

There are several additional methods that items can be crafted, and these methods can even be used together.

### Upgrading

Rather than making an item from scratch, an item can be upgraded into a similar item with an alternate [qualities](/Appendix/Equipment_Properties#item-qualities). For example: superior quality items have a cost increase of either +50 or ×4 the cost of the base item (whichever is greater). When upgrading an item, determine the difficulty by the total cost of the item, and the time by the difference in the cost of the item.

##### Crafting Example: Upgrading
> **Item Cost:** 100  
> **Quality Cost:** +50 or ×4
> ___
> **Total Cost:** 400 = 100 × 4  
> **Difficulty:** 10
> ___
> **Upgrade Cost:** 300 = 400 - 100  
> **Upgrade Time:** 5 days

### Bulk Crafting

Multiple identical items can be made as a part of a single craft check by combining their costs together. The time to craft the item is determined by the combined cost of that item, but the difficulty remains the same.

> ##### Crafting Example: Bulk Crafting
> **Item Cost:** 5  
> **Difficulty:** 4  
> **Time:** 1 hour
> ___
> **Quantity:** 10  
> **Bulk Cost:** 50 = 5 × 10  
> **Time:** 1 day

### Extended Crafting

If you find yourself with exceptionally long periods of time available to craft items, you may extend the crafting time while also reducing the difficulty to craft. This can both make success easier to reach and possibly result in a higher cost discount. The maximum amount that you are allowed to extend crafting time is determined by your craft skill rank.

##### Table: Extended Crafting Limit
| Craft<br/>Skill | Rank<br/>Name | Maximum<br/>Adjustments |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| d4 | Trained | 1 |
| d6 | Adept | 2 |
| d8 | Proficient | 3 |
| d10 | Expert | 4 |
| d12 | Master | 5 |

For each adjustment, treat the difficulty as 1 lower and the time as if the difficulty was 1 higher.

> ##### Crafting Example: Extended Crafting
> **Item Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 8  
> **Time:** 2 days
> ___
> **Adjustments:** 2  
> **New Difficulty:** 6 (from 8)  
> **New Time:** 5 days (from 2 days)

### Rushed Crafting

Rushed crafting is an alternative to partial crafting where you may shorten the crafting time but at the cost of increasing the difficulty. The maximum amount that you are allowed to shorten crafting time is determined by your craft skill rank.

##### Table: Rushed Crafting Limit
| Craft<br/>Skill | Rank<br/>Name | Maximum<br/>Adjustments |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| d4 | Trained | 1 |
| d6 | Adept | 2 |
| d8 | Proficient | 3 |
| d10 | Expert | 4 |
| d12 | Master | 5 |

For each adjustment, treat the difficulty as 1 higher and the time as if the difficulty as 1 lower. This cannot be used to increase the difficulty higher than what you are normally allowed to craft as determined by your intelligence and craft skill.

> ##### Crafting Example: Rushed Crafting
> **Item Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 8  
> **Time:** 2 days
> ___
> **Adjustments:** 3  
> **New Difficulty:** 11 (from 8)  
> **New Time:** 2 hours (from 2 days)

### Group Crafting

Multiple characters can work together to perform a craft both speeding up the process and with the potential for more consistent results. The total time a craft takes is directly proportional to the number of characters involved. Characters do not need to have the craft skill or to be able to directly craft the item to help, but if they are not capable of contributing something to the craft then they are treated as half of a participant.

> ##### Crafting Example: Group Crafting
> **Cost:** 1000  
> **Difficulty:** 12  
> **Time:** 10 days
> ___
> **Participants:** 3.5  
> **New Time:** 2.9 days = 10 days / 3.5 participants  
> **Time in Hours:** 2.9 days × 8 hours = 23 hours

So long as one participant succeeds then the craft is successful. Regardless of success or failure, use the highest discount (if it succeeds) or progress (if it fails) for the craft.
