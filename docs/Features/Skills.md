<!--Merge some stuff into handling???-->

Craft can also be used to make higher quality custom equipment. When doing so, it will require that you have a toolkit dedicated to the type of craft work you want to pursue (or a workshop containing those tools) and a proficiency that relates to the type of items you are crafting. If you do not possess some measure of these things, you can always work together with other characters.

#### Insight (INT)

Insight represents your ability to recall information and work with information. It can be anything from the widely available to the potentially unknown, such as historical events, people, organizations, secret societies, or the occult. This skill can also be used to make effective work studying new topics, with difficulty depending on your level of familiarity or the complexity of the material.

#### Networking (STR/INT/RES)

Sometimes you just know someone who can get what you need done, and if you don't, maybe you know how to find one. In a city or town there's always that somebody. This skill can be used to find people in areas where tracking them directly can't quite get the job done. It is likely that this task may involve bribes or threats. This skill may even used to determine if you already have an existing rapport with newly introduced non-player characters. Often times using this skill can result in the creation of non-player characters solely to fulfill the purpose of the tasks, such as calling in favours or adding those characters as a reference for your character to call upon later.

#### Perception (INT/DEX)

Perception is used to search with the senses (using dexterity) or apply existing information with deduction (using intelligence) to discover things in the immediate surroundings or current situation. This can mean tracking creatures, detecting stealthy individuals, or finding hidden secrets or traps. If one or more of your senses are limited or unavailable, perception can be used to detect things with your remaining senses.

#### Taming (STR/RES)

In the wild, many animals are unfriendly or fearful towards the majority of people. This skill allows you to speak to and calm down such animals. It can also be used to convince certain animals, like guard dogs, that you are friendly much in the same way you could use charisma to intimidate or persuade someone. While this skill does not provide the ability to understand animals directly, it does provide the ability to share in confidence and trust, and to form an emotional bond with animals. Some animals that spend lots of time around people, like cats and dogs, are also capable of responding to very simple spoken requests once this trust is assured. The types of animals that do not respond to commands might instead respond to simple gestures that can signal basic requests. This includes directing domesticated animals like cattle and horses.

##### Table: Supernatural Skills
| Name | Attributes |
|:-|:-|

| [Sorcery](#sorcery-res) | RES |
| [Superpowers](#superpowers) | Any |
| [Wizardry](#wizardry-int) | INT |

#### Animism (RES)

Nature is a fundamental force that governs reality and animism allows you to connect to that force. Animists, often called *druids*, do not require any special items to use powers as nature itself is the conduit. Powers used by animism are considered *magical*, are often called *spells*, and require *focus* to use. Animism has three proficiencies which represent different ideological connections to nature:

##### Table: Animism Proficiencies
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Balance | Life and death are two sides of the same coin. Those that seek to control one or the other misrepresent the duality of nature. It is only by recognizing this balance that you can see nature as it truly is. |
| Cultivation | Nature is the universal machine to which all existing things are cogs. This machine cannot exist without its pieces holding it together. It is your mission to maintain all things that exist to satisfy the universal machine. |
| Entropy | All things must come to an end; this is the mantra of entropy. You are an agent that represents this notion. Although you do not seek to destroy without cause, you will not hesitate to fulfil the inevitable truth. |

Characters can only have one animism proficiency as they are fundamentally conflicting ideologies.

#### Communion (RES)

The power of communion is derived from an external entity that bestows its powers to a character. Individuals who follow in a lifestyle connected to an entity are often called *clerics* or *warlocks* depending on the public image of that entity. Powers used by communion are considered *magical*, are often called *spells*, and require *focus* to use. Communion proficiencies are built from three different ideological axes: *altruism* vs *militarism*, *impulse* vs *discipline*, and *liberty* vs *authority*.

##### Table: Communion Ideologies
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Altruism | When others are in need, it is you who will provide. This ideology spans the providence of both supportive actions and the gifting of material goods. Being altruistic is more than just providing when it is necessary, it is also the search for such opportunities. |
| Militarism | While kindness is an option, it is easier to demonstrate the cost of failure with a show of force. Militarism is not solely about violence: it is the drive to demonstrate your ideals even if others do not agree. What people want is not necessarily what people need. |
| Impulse | Opportunity is essentially a divine portent. Whenever opportunities arise that align with your goals they must be taken. Any other action is a failure to utilize the divine gift given to you. Searching for opportunities is not necessarily a goal, rather that opportunities are everywhere and just waiting to be seen. |
| Discipline | Action itself is less important than recognizing when that action is necessary. Although it may appear as though opportunities are constant, many of which can easily become distractions that prevent you from truly exemplifying your ideals at a better time. |
| Liberty | Freedom in all forms matters more to you than any one rule can provide. Although others are free to follow their own paths, if an individual or group's cause stands in the way of the freedom others, then that path is a restriction guised by a mask of freedom. |
| Authority | Governance without rule of law can quickly devolve into chaos. Without the guide of authority, actions are easily taken with disregard for consequence. This reckless behaviour can very easily have unintended effects. It is safer to follow law than act without guidance. |

The combination of these ideological axes result in eight different proficiencies:

##### Table: Communion Proficiencies by Ideological Axes
| Proficiency | First Axis | Second Axis | Third Axis |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Charity | Altruism | Impulse | Liberty |
| Community | Altruism | Impulse | Authority |
| Peace | Altruism | Discipline | Liberty |
| Service | Altruism | Discipline | Authority |
| Anarchy | Militarism | Impulse | Liberty |
| Tyranny | Militarism | Impulse | Authority |
| Justice | Militarism | Discipline | Liberty |
| Order | Militarism | Discipline | Authority |

Characters can only have one of these proficiencies as they are fundamentally conflicting ideologies that represent that character's relationship with their beliefs and their benefactor entity. Alternatively, worship of a specific entity or religion may be substituted for an ideological proficiency (as one necessitates the other).

#### Ki

All things have some form of spirit and ki is a manifestation of spirit in the form of an aura. Control over ki is control over one's own auras. Typically this form of magic is performed by those who meditate on the deeper parts of themselves. Those who can control their auras are often known as *sōhei* or *monks*. Powers used by ki are considered *nonmagical* and each ki proficiency uses a different resource and attribute. Ki has four different proficiencies to choose from which are the four auras:

##### Table: Ki Proficiencies
| Name | Attribute | Resource | Description |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Genki (Vigour) | STR | Health | Control of the body, mastery of strength. Genki is the spirit of flesh and might. This aura can be utilized to increase your combat potential and push your strength beyond the natural limits one might think is possible. |
| Kiai (Projection) | DEX | Stamina | Kiai is the spirit of your movement and the air you breathe, the air that feeds your body and mind. With the use of this aura your movements will become fast and effortless, the air around you will become an extension of your body. |
| Shouki (Mind) | INT | Focus | Mastery of mind allows you to rely on the power of your thoughts and consciousness rather than the strength of your muscles. Your body will act as a mere vessel holding the extending reach of your mind. |
| Yuuki (Courage) | RES | Endurance | This is the spirit that holds your body and mind together to act as a single force. With the embodiment of courage you need not body nor mind alone to prove yourself. |

#### Psionics (INT)

?

#### Sorcery (RES)

Sorcery is the natural style of spellcasting. Powers used by sorcery are considered *magical*, are often called *spells*, and require *focus* to use. It has seven proficiencies of a philosophical or classical nature:

##### Table: Sorcery Proficiencies
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Air | Power over air allows you to control the wind itself. Lifting and moving objects become as easy to you as the wind can carry a leaf or feather. Sound and electricity are also associated with air. |
| Earth | Force and stability are the earth's primary strengths. The element of earth is a true testament to force of will. Additionally, this covers the domain of plants. |
| Fire | If you try hard enough just about anything can be burned. Strong emotions like anger and love are also aspects of fire. Fire is about passion and intensity. |
| Water | Water is about more than just getting things wet; water also represents flow and calming energy. Although sound is generally associated with air, you could say that music is also like water. Cold temperatures are also associated with water. |
| Light | While illumination is quite literal, and truth is quite philosophical, they are very similar in nature. Light is about revealing what is hidden. |
| Darkness | As a counter to light, darkness is about concealment. Darkness is not simply evil. Some truths are painful to bear, and darkness would rather hide those truths. |
| Arcane | The power of arcane represents the space between space. Many things that one might describe as blatantly magical are more accurately arcane. Arcane is a powerful force that seems to defy the normal rules that might apply to the other elements. |

The true limits of sorcery are as boundless as the imagination and a sorcerer could optionally have any proficiency from any other magical supernatural skill instead of being limited to only sorcery proficiencies. Any other properties of that skill are not also granted. This only grants access to those spells through the method of sorcery.

> ***Example***  
> ?

Sorcerers have it a bit easier than others when it comes to casting spells. When casting spells using sorcery, your profiency is also added to your luck roll. Additionally, whenever your luck roll succeeds, you recover 1 focus (even if the spell fails).

#### Superpowers

?

#### Wizardry (INT)

Wizardry is the educated style of spellcasting. Powers used by sorcery are considered *magical*, are often called *spells*, and require *focus* to use. It has six different proficiencies which are the six schools of magic:

##### Table: Wizardry Proficiencies
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Abjuration | Abjurors warp both the effects and perceptions of reality. They can protect against magical effects and create illusions that trick the senses but have no real physical interaction. |
| Conjuration | Conjurors create interactable and solid imitations of reality, usually with limited permanence. These types of effects are primarily limited to things you can sense (see, hear, touch, taste, and smell). |
| Divination | Diviners are the types of wizards who like to know things and solve complex problems. Divination can be used to collect information from obscure sources or provide reconnaissance. |
| Enchantment | Enchanting is the process of using magic to alter how things function or improve how they function. This type of magic can be used on both objects and people and usually results in effects that appear obviously supernatural. |
| Evocation | Evokers are typically known for one simple thing: destruction. However, evocation is also capable of eliciting strong emotions, making it useful for motivating, inspiring, and inciting others. |
| Transmutation | Transmuters can change one thing into something else or repair what is broken. Transmutation focuses on the alteration of physical things and does not necessarily provide results that one would assume are of a magical nature. |

Unlike other spellcasters, wizards generally rely on physical materials (primarily a spellbook containing scrolls) but have access to a wider array of spells. Additionally, wizards are not limited to any one proficiency and may choose to master them all. Wizards can cast *any* spell in their proficiency (limited as normal by the highest tier they have available) but as a result *all* spells are more difficult to cast. When using the wizardry skill, all spells have their focus cost increased by 1 and difficulty increased by 3. Learning a spell removes the focus cost penalty, and using a spell scroll removes the difficulty penalty. Scrolls also allow characters to cast wizardry spells untrained. This also means that access to powerful scrolls can allow trained wizards to cast spells beyond their normal limitations.
