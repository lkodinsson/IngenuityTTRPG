Rogues may have a bad reputation in some circles, but that's mostly the fault of assassins. It's not entirely without reason, however, as both assassins and rogues prefer to slink in the shadows. Assassins excel primarily at inflicting death. While this is true, they owe it to their medicinal knowledge. This type of knowledge allows them to prepare both poisons and antidotes.

<!--Not to be confused with Hitmen, who specialize in firearms (sniper rifles) to kill people.-->

Bards, much like wizards, are educated and personable. Bards use cleverness and a sharp tongue to overcome challenges. Given the more well-rounded education that a bard possesses, they might be considered a jack-of-all-trades. They are often a reasonable substitute when a specialist is unavailable.

**Skills** [Charisma](/Features/Skills#charisma-res), [Combat](/Features/Skills#combat-str-dex), [Handling](/Features/Skills#handling-int-dex), [Insight](/Features/Skills#insight-int), [Wizardry](/Features/Skills#wizardry-int)

While fighters might choose diplomacy, or champions might seek to protect their allies, berserkers live for combat above all else. Berserkers can harness the power of pure rage in combat to deliver powerful blows and shrug off pain. Typically, those who might call themselves berserkers are those from more tribal and militaristic societies, or those who engage in the sport of fighting others like gladiators.

While clerics can represent the full spectrum of the devoted, champions represent the militaristic strong arm of these ideologies. They are there to protect those they declare in need, primarly those who follow tenets resembling their own. They are often drafted as mercenaries to empires who show loyalty to their cause.

Many people have a code they follow that defines who they are, but clerics make it a part of their life's work. Clerics are often guides and teachers. Despite the work put into their faith and those involved, they typically do not create their own following. They are more likely to gather a following in the name of whatever divine entity they believe in, rather than for themselves.

Druids are magic users that are in tune with the forces of nature. Druids are rare to meet as they are typically ascetics detached from civilization. While many of them do live in the wild, some of them do occasionally interact with other people. Usually this is just to maintain some form of diplomatic position or to dissuade others from encroaching on nature.

**Attribute** d6 **Intelligence**

Whether it is for honor, glory, revenge, or to defend the weak, fighters are skilled in the arts of combat and warfare. Through the use of various combat maneuvers, fighters are vital to winning various conflicts of physical prowess. Although fighters are primarily combatants, they are also often skilled in the application of medicine and diplomacy.

The might of the magister sits deep within their mind, for above all else a magister is educated. Magisters dedicate themselves to preparing for both the known and unknown. If there is a task that someone else cannot complete, the magister is likely to be capable of finding or creating the solution.

Body, mind, and spirit are the domains of monks. Through meditation and constant martial discipline, monks are capable of asserting forces beyond what one might believe possible. The way of the monk is more about mastery of one's-self rather than mastery over others. This does not mean that monks are pacifists, however, as they will often defend themselves if given good reason.

**Attribute** For genki: d6 **Strength**; for kiai: d6 **Dexterity**; for shouki: d6 **Intelligence**; and for yuuki: d6 **Resolve**

Some people prefer to live among nature, where insight is a key component to survival and understanding. Survival in nature requires a keen eye and a sharp mind; those who call themselves rangers have a strong ability to solve puzzles or understand complicated mysteries and a personal association with nature. Rangers are often found acting as guardians or managers of a natural wildlife habitat.

**Attribute** d6 **Strength** *and* **Intelligence**

#### Rogue
| [Rogue](#rogue) | DEX | Agility, Charisma, Combat, Handling, Perception | Sabotage, Search, Sleight, Stealth | Danger Sense (Rank 1), Longevity (+4) | ? |

The world is full of dangers and unknowns. Rogues live and breathe in the world of peril, prepared to fight back with sharp wits or sharp blades. They are particularly known for their ability to tamper with various devices, such as traps and locks. It is likely that they are great thieves and smugglers, but it might not be safe to say it to their faces.

**Attribute** d6 **Dexterity**  
**Skills** Agility, Charisma, Combat, Handling, Perception  
**Proficiencies** Sabotage, Search, Sleight, Stealth

#### Sorcerer
| [Sorcerer](#sorcerer) | RES | Charisma, Contacts, Insight, Sorcery, Taming | ? | ? | ? |

Sorcerers are like wizards in that they are known for their magic, but it is not a power they have learned from study. This ability to cast spells is innate and a major part of their personality. As a result, sorcerers are often outgoing and are highly sociable, even with animals.

**Attribute** d6 **Resolve**  
**Skills** Charisma, Contacts, Insight, Sorcery, Taming  
**Proficiencies** Persuade, Resilience, ?; and one of Air/Earth/Fire/Water/Light/Darkness/Arcane

#### Theurge
| [Theurge](#theurge) | INT *and* RES | Communion, Craft, Insight, Perception, Wizardry | ? | ? | ? |

Theurges are powerful spellcasters dedicated to the pursuit of occult mastery. In addition to educating themselves on how to cast spells, they will also devote themselves to a higher power to acquire more spellcasting ability. Theurges believe they are more powerful than other spellcasters, but due to their higher rate of seclusion in the pursuit of eldritch knowledge, they are also typically lesser known.

**Attribute** d6 **Intelligence** *and* **Resolve**

#### Warmage
| [Warmage](#warmage) | STR *and* INT | Athletics, Combat, Handling, Perception, Wizardry | Cooking, Heal, Martial, Abjuration/Evocation | ? | ? |

Where fighters might represent more varied martial roles, warmages are trained more specifically for war. Empires prefer to employ warmages due to their affiliation with the military, rather than wizards who are more likely to seek their own interests. While warmages lack the diplomatic tact of their fighter counterparts, they are still capable of administering general medicine.

#### Wizard
| [Wizard](#wizard) | INT | Charisma, Craft, Insight, Perception, Wizardry | ? | ? | ? |

When it comes to both acts of magery and knowledge of ancient secrets, wizards stand at the forefront. Similar to clerics, wizards are often guides and teachers; they are known because of their relationships with others. Wizards are often sought out by both adventurers and normal folk alike to help them find solutions to their problems. Even if magic isn't the required answer, the wizard might still have access to useful knowledge.
