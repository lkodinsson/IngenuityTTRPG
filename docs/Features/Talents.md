#### Arcane Synthesis

**Cost:** 4/6/8 EXP  
**Requirements:** Intelligence d6, Trained in Wizardry and Craft

**Action** Create an unstable version of a magic item from any nonmagical item. This does not require a craft check.

All items created by this ability lose their effects if not used before a week has passed since their creation. Items can only contain one synthesized magic effect at a time.

**Requirements:** Intelligence d6 or Resolve d6, Can use powers

When you acquire this talent you will choose a metapower category from the table below.

Before using any power, you may choose to modify it using any metapower talents you have acquired. When you do, you will increase or decrease its focus cost for each use of any metapower modifier.

For each power that you use, you can modify it a number of times equal to the total number of different metapower talents that you have.

| Fickle | - | The power has its duration halved (when you stack this metapower it decreases from halved to thirded, to quartered, and so on) |
| Heightened | +1 | The power gets +2 to its difficulty to be resisted |

| Persistent | +1 | The power has its duration doubled (when you stack this metapower it increases from doubled to tripled, to quadrupled, and so on) |

| Reaching | +1 | The power has its range doubled, or increased to 3m if it had a range of only touch (when you stack this metapower it increases from doubled to tripled, to quadrupled, and so on) |
| Reduced | - | The power has its area or radius halved (when you stack this metapower it decreases from halved to thirded, to quartered, and so on) |
| Shortened | - | The power has its range halved (when you stack this metapower it decreases from halved to thirded, to quartered, and so on) |

| Widened | +2 | The power has its area or radius doubled (when you stack this metapower it increases from doubled to tripled, to quadrupled, and so on) |

<sup>1</sup> For triggered metapowers any condition is valid so long as it is knowable by the user or provided by the context of the power.

#### Spell Preparation

**Cost:** 4 EXP  
**Requirements:** Intelligence d6, Trained in Wizardry

Instead of casting a wizardry spell, you may store it as an effect in concentration. To do so, first cast the spell as normal paying the action cost (if the spell is a reaction then as one action instead), making your skill check and luck roll, then paying the focus cost. Instead of resolving the spell immediately, simply record the results of your roll. At a later time you may cast the stored spell (releasing it from concentration) as a free action (or as a free reaction if it was a reaction) using your recorded roll instead of rolling the normal skill check (and without the focus cost since it was already paid). Stored spells are still affected by the multiple power penalty when cast.

If you no longer wish to cast a prepared spell, you may simply release it by ending the concentration or by preparing another one to replace it.

For effects that don't have a difficulty, instead you will need to roll a value equal to 20 or greater.

<!--When you become unconscious or stunned, instead of immediately losing concentration on effects, compare your willpower against the difficulty to use the ability providing the effect.
