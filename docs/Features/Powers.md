#### Alter Size

**Specializations:** Enchantment, Transmutation  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Greater)

**Action Type:** Two Actions

**Range:** 5m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Duration:** 15 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Fortitude

Increase or decrease the size of a creature or object. For each size beyond the first, increase the difficulty by 3. For example: If you are increasing or decreasing the size of a creature by 2, the difficulty would increase by 3 from 6 to 9.

When a creature's size is changed its speed is increased or decreased relative to the change, and its size multiplier is changed to reflect its new size. Creatures and objects changed to a size smaller than 1 become microscopic and are effectively undetectable until the duration wears off (but are also too small to move any meaningful distance).

The difference in size between creatures may affect the difficulty of some actions as those creatures interact with each other (such as attacks).

##### Table: Size Multipliers
| Size | Size Name | Size<br/>Multiplier |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| 1 | Very Tiny | 0.1 |
| 2 | Tiny | 0.4 |
| 3 | Very Small | 0.9 |
| 4 | Small | 1.6 |
| 5 | Medium | 2.5 |
| 6 | Large | 3.6 |
| 7 | Very Large | 4.9 |
| 8 | Huge | 6.4 |
| 9 | Very Huge | 8.1 |
| 10 | Gigantic | 10 |
| 11 | Very Gigantic | 12.1 |
| 12 | Enormous | 14.4 |
| 13 | Very Enormous | 16.9 |
| 14 | Massive | 19.6 |
| 15 | Very Massive | 22.5 |
| 16 | Tremendous | 25.6 |
| 17 | Very Tremendous | 28.9 |
| 18 | Colossal | 32.4 |
| 19 | Very Colossal | 36.1 |
| 20 | Titanic | 40 |

***Critical:*** You may increase or decrease the size by 1 more.

#### Animal Form

**Specializations:** Animism  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Two Actions

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** 24 hours (concentration)

You take the form of any animal you can imagine. Specifically, you transform into any beast type creature. For each difference in size between you and the chosen beast, increase the difficulty by 3. For example: If you are medium sized (5) creature and you wanted to transform into a bear, which is a very large (7) beast, the difficulty would increase by 6 from 6 to 12.

While transformed, your physical attributes (strength and dexterity) temporarily become that of the chosen beast. Since this is a temporary change your derived stats are not affected, but you will use your transformed strength and dexterity values when making skill checks and attack rolls. If your size becomes changed then your size multiplier and speed also become adjusted. Additionally, you acquire any natural weapons and abilities from the chosen beast. You cannot acquire abilities you already have, but stronger versions of the same abilities will replace your existing ones. While in this form your physical equipment still exists and can still provide their stats while equipped and magical effects from attunement, but you are otherwise no longer considered to have access your items.

For example: If you transformed into a bear, this would change your strength to ? and your dexterity to ?, even if they were higher.

As an animal you may still speak to other animals that are similar to you, but lose the ability to otherwise speak normally and use other powers.

#### Arcane Missiles

**Specializations:** Arcane, Conjuration, Evocation  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** One Action

**Range:** 40m  
**Target:** One or more creatures or objects  
**Resist:** Deflection (for reduced damage)

You shoot three arcane missiles from a single power attack each dealing 2 arcane damage to up to three targets. These missiles *always* hit. If multiple missiles hit the same target, they deal damage together as if they were one hit. The minimum damage dealt to each target is 1 for each missile targeting them.

***Critical:*** Each missile deals an additional 1 damage.

#### Bless

**Specializations:** Altruism, Cultivation, Liberty, Light  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** One Action

**Range:** Touch or 20m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 15 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of purpose. They get a +1 bonus to all rolls. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking words of good fortune, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus. This spell and the curse spell cancel each other out.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell curse does on living creatures.

#### Blessing Chant

**Specializations:** Altruism, Liberty  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Two Actions

**Range:** 20m  
**Target:** One or more creatures  
**Duration:** 15 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You repeatedly vocalize a chant of purpose and good fortune, giving one or more creatures within range a +1 bonus to all rolls. The effect from this spell and the curse or cursing chant spells cancel each other out.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell cursing chant does on living creatures.
