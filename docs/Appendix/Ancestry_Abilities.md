---

#### Adaptation

**Point Cost:** 2

Provides a +1 bonus to any one specified skill, but at the cost of a -1 penalty to another specified skill.

---

#### Brave

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature gets a +1 bonus to willpower to resist any effects that would cause them fear.

---

#### Construct

**Point Cost:** 3

The creature's body is constructed of various artificial materials and does not perform normal biological functions. They are immune to being sick (like poison and disease), are no longer required to eat, drink, or sleep, but instead require at least 7 hours of full sunlight every week to remain powered. They may enter a low powered state to extend that duration to 7 years, but cannot take any actions except powering back up during this time. If they completely lose power or choose to power down completely, they cannot awaken unless brought to full charge or another creature activates them. Additionally, any lightning damage taken instead acts like an equivalent number of hours charging in sunlight. Any damage taken in excess of a full charge is treated as normal.

The creature does not recover 1 health after a rest. They may be repaired during a rest using the craft skill the same way a normal creature would using the medicine skill instead. Additionally, if they would be repaired by a special ability (like the [Mend](/Features/Powers#mend) power), they also recover an additional 1 health.

The creature also gets natural armour as a part of its body, which can be modified like any other armour, or replaced by any other metal armour type. This natural armour only applies its armour rating and damage reduction if they are greater than any body armour that they are also wearing. By default the natural armour provides 2 armour rating and 3 damage resistance. This armour is treated as having a cost of 50 for the purposes of crafting upgrades onto it. This armour considered to be a part of its body and is not considered to be worn.

#### Fungal Body

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature has no mouth and cannot speak normally, but can speak mentally to any living creature they are directly touching as long as the recipient is willing. This communication does not require that both creatures speak the same language but some may find it intrusive. The sporecap on their head prevents them from wearing any kind of headgear, but they can emit spores to identify the position of nearby creatures regardless of lighting conditions. These spores also allow them to communicate with each other without directly touching.

---

#### Generalist

**Point Cost:** 1

Whenever the creature acquires a new skill or talent it costs 1 less experience.

---

#### Graceful

**Point Cost:** 2

Provides a +1 bonus to agility and athletics checks when leaping, running, climbing, or evading.

---

#### Grit

**Point Cost:** 1

Provides a +1 bonus to maximum health, endurance, stamina, and focus.

---

#### Headstrong

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature gets a +1 bonus to charisma checks to intimdate other creatures and a +1 bonus to willpower to resist being influenced in the same way.

---

#### Inferiority

**Point Cost:** -2

The creature gets a -1 penalty to a specified attribute.

---

#### Iron Gut

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature gets a +2 bonus to fortitude to resist any effects that would make them sick (such as poison, disease, or drinking alcohol).

---

#### Languages

**Point Cost:** 1 or more

The creature gets a number of additional native languages known equal to the number of points spent on this ability.

---

#### Lucky

**Point Cost:** 2

The creature gets a +1 bonus to luck rolls.

---

#### Magical

**Point Cost:** 2 to 4

The creature is magical in its very nature. Any natural armour and weapons the creature has are considered magical, and the creature gains the ability to cast one or more spell powers. The number of ancestry points on this ability determines the number of spells granted. One, two, or three spells are granted if 2, 3, or 4 points are spent respectively. When casting a spell power granted by this ability, intelligence and resolve are rolled together instead of the normal skill check. A luck roll is still made when using a spell power in this way.

---

#### Natural Armour

**Point Cost:** 1 to 4

The creature gets a defensive bonus from a specified natural armour as listed below. The natural armour only applies its armour rating and damage resistance if they are greater than any body armour that the creature is also wearing.

##### Table: Natural Body Armours
| Name | Point<br/>Cost | Armour<br/>Rating | Damage<br/>Reduction |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Hide | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Thick Hide | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| Carapace | 3 | 3 | 5 |
| Scales | 4 | 4 | 7 |

As an additional cost the creature may also gain one or more of the bonuses listed below. These bonuses always apply, even if the creature is wearing body armour.

##### Table: Natural Additional Armours
| Name | Point<br/>Cost | Features |
|:-|:-:|:-|
| Horns | 1 | Parry 3, cannot wear head armour (except for hoods which do not hide the horns) unless it is [custom fitted](/Appendix/Equipment_Properties#custom-fit) |
| Shell | 1 | +1 armour rating when attacked from behind |

---

#### Natural Talent

**Point Cost:** 1 to 3

The creature gains any talent (except for Wild Aspect) as if it was an ancestry ability. It does not need to meet any of the talent's requirements to acquire it as an ancestry ability. The point cost of this ability depends on the experience cost of the talent.

##### Table: Natural Talent Cost
| Talent<br/>Cost | Point<br/>Cost |
|:-:|:-:|
| 4+ | 1 |
| 8+ | 2 |
| 12+ | 3 |

If that creature later spends experience points to acquire that talent again (if possible) they are treated as if they didn't already have that talent for the purpose of calculating additional experience costs and the talent can only be advanced to its normal limit. For example: If the creature has Toughness (+4) from Natural Talent and the creature advances it, then it will only cost 4 experience (instead of 6) because it is the first time it is spending experience on it and it can still only be advanced to its normal limit of +12.

---

#### Natural Weapon

**Point Cost:** 1

The creature gains up to two weapons from the natural weapons table below:

##### Table: Natural Weapons

#### Vision

**Point Cost:** -1 to 3

The creature has modified vision depending on the type of vision chosen from the list below. Each type has a listed point cost. Creatures can only have one type of vision, replacing standard vision (the ability to see with a light source such as daylight). If a type of vision makes it more or less difficult to interact under certain circumstances, this provides either an advantage or disadvantage to relevant skill checks.

##### Table: Vision Types

|:-|:-|:-|
| Adaptive | 2 | Over a period of about a minute, the creature can adapt its vision to either that of dark vision or low-light vision. |
| Auditory | 1 | The creature can see the reflection of sound waves upon objects. Movement that creates noise is very easy to spot, but anything else is nearly impossible. |
| Blind | -1 | The creature cannot see at all, but can still use its other senses with some difficulty. |
| Dark | 1 | The creature can see in both areas devoid of light and poorly lit areas with ease, but have difficulty seeing in broad daylight. |
| Hunter | 2 | Over a period of about a minute, the creature can adapt its vision to either that of infrared vision or low-light vision. |
| Infrared | 1 | The creature can see the shapes of objects via heat making cold-blooded creatures difficult to detect or warm-blooded creatures difficult to detect in hot areas. |
| Lightless | 2 | The creature can see as if it has both auditory and infrared visions. |
| Low-light | 1 | The creature can see in both daylight and poorly lit areas with ease. |
| Ultra | 3 | The creature can see under any lightning conditions. It can also very easily make out the shapes of objects from noise and heat alone. |
