# Currencies

There are various types of currencies that represent the money your character needs to spend on items and goods. All of the values of items are represented by a cost in a generic unit of money. Different currencies have a value relative to the generic unit of money. In one genre the cost of an item may be measured in dollars ($) and in another the cost could measured in silver pieces (sp). Sometimes there may be additional currencies usable at the same time like nuyen (¥) or gold pieces (gp).
