title: Maneuvers
---

Maneuvers are associated with *mundane skills* and require spending a resource like *stamina* or *focus*. They provide special effects which cannot be achieved simply by succeeding a test. This can include special types of attacks, using skills in unconventional ways, and providing special bonuses to allies. The steps to perform a maneuver are as follows:

* Wait for the complete action time
* Pay the listed resource cost
* Make a test with a listed skill and proficiency
* Apply the effect of the maneuver based on the test

All manuevers require a test to determine the degree of their effect and many of these are made as contests against other characters.

### Maneuvers as Attacks

Many maneuvers allow you to make attacks that deliver additional effects. Attacks made this way are made as normal then provide an additional effect if they hit their target. When they do, you compare the result of your combat test from your attack against a specified defence from that target. If that also succeeds, you apply the additional effect. No additional roll is required unless the maneuver specifies multiple tests.

Attacks made by maneuvers are also subject to the *multiple attack penalty*. This means that they receive a -2 penalty for each attack made before it during the same round. Typically this only occurs in combat.

### Improvising Maneuvers

Characters may use any maneuver, including ones that they have not learned. This is called *improvising a maneuver*. Characters that improvise a maneuver do so with a -1 penalty to *all* tests made during that maneuver.
