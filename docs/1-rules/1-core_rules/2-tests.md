title: Tests
---

Whenever you attempt a task and success is not guaranteed, then you will need to make a *test*. To do so, you will roll a relevant *attribute* and *skill*, add any one relevant *proficiency* (if any), then compare your result to a secretly determined *difficulty value*. In order to succeed at the task, the result of the test must *meet or exceed* its difficulty.

:::info Example

Fabian attempts to pick a locked door.  
The game master determines that they will need to roll *dexterity* and *handling* for this test.  
Fabian also has the *sleight* proficiency, which they can use for this task.  
With a dexterity of d6, a handling of d6, and a sleight of +1, Fabian rolls 2d6+1.  
The test results in a value of 8, which the game master determines is enough to succeed at the task.

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty<br/>(Common) | Name | Difficulty<br/>(Rare) | Name |
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-|
| - | Trivial | 14 | Demanding |
| 4 | Simple | 16 | Daunting |
| 6 | Standard | 18 | Arduous |
| 8 | Moderate | 20 | Ambitious |
| 10 | Challenging | 22 | Absurd |
| 12 | Complex | 24 | Improbable |

:::note

The most common type of task is *trivial* (no test).  
Tasks requiring a test will usually range in difficulty from *simple* (4) to *complex* (12).  
Tasks with a difficulty of *demanding* (14) or higher are *much rarer*.

:::

All characters can perform *any* test, even if they are both untrained and nonproficient.

:::info Example

Priscilla attempts to climb a single story wall using a rope and grappling hook.  
The game master determines that they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics* for this test.  
However, Priscilla is not trained in athletics and does not have any relevant proficiency.  
With only a strength of d4 and an athletics of d4 (untrained), Priscilla rolls 2d4.

:::

Tasks that are *trivial* never require tests. For some sufficiently proficient characters, even other more difficult tasks can also become effectively trivial. With a high enough bonus from a proficiency the lowest possible roll can catch up to some difficulty values.

:::info Example

Over time Fabian improves his stats and attempts a familiar task: picking a locked door.  
The game master notices that he has a +4 in *sleight*.  
The lowest possible roll that Fabian can achieve is a 6 (two dice plus 4).  
If the task has a difficulty of 6 or less, the game master can decide to skip the dice roll.

:::

## Assists

In situations where only one character can perform the task but other characters still want to help, they may instead assist the character performing the task. To do so, they must perform the exact same test using the same attribute, skill, and proficiency (if any). This provides a bonus to that character's test based on the highest threshold that the assisting character's roll meets or exceeds.

##### Table: Assist Thresholds
| Threshold | Bonus |
|:-:|:-:|
| 4 (Simple) | +1 |
| 8 (Moderate) | +2 |
| 12 (Complex) | +3 |
| 16 (Daunting) | +4 |

:::info Example

:::

If multiple characters provide assistance simultaneously, use only the highest assist bonus provided from those characters.

## Contests

When two characters are making tests against each other, this is called a *contest*. Usually this means that one character is setting the difficulty for the other. These types of contests resolve the same way as normal tests.

:::info Example

Markos is sneaking around the palace and the guards are on high alert.  
When Markos makes his test to be stealthy, the guards will make a test to search for intruders.  
In this way, the guards are setting the difficulty for Markos' test.

:::

In circumstances where characters are performing the *same activity* against each other, they are both setting the difficulty for each other. Normally when performing a test you must meet or exceed the difficulty, but in this type of circumstance one of the characters must *exceed* the other.

:::info Example

Arnold and Siegmund engage in an arm wrestle.  
The game master determines that they will both need to roll *strength* and *athletics*.  
Arnold rolls an 11 and Siegmund rolls an 8.  
Arnold beats Siegmund at the arm wrestle.

:::

:::note

If a contest where both characters are performing the same activity results in a tie, usually nothing happens.  
In circumstances like these, the contest usually repeats until one character beats the other.  
Alternatively, this can sometimes be resolved as a best-of-three or best-of-five to increase tension.

:::

### Size Differences

If there is a difference in size between two characters during a contest, the result of the test is modified by an amount equal to this difference. Typically this occurs for tasks that involve physical activites using *strength* or *dexterity*, such as trying to push or catch another creature.

:::info Example

Ursula is trying to catch a mouse, which is much smaller than her.  
Because Ursula is medium sized (4) and the mouse is miniscule sized (1), she is larger by a difference of 3.  
When she rolls for the contest to catch the mouse, she will treat the mouse's roll as increased by 3, making it more difficult.

:::

## Passive Tests

Sometimes when characters interact with each other or the environment, some outcomes can be determined automatically by making a *passive test* using certain stats as a difficulty value. These stats are calculated using *passive values* from some of your other stats.

:::info Example

Siegmund decides to punch Arnold, making a test using his *strength* and *combat*.  
In order to hit Arnold, he must meet or exceed his *evasion*.  
Arnold's evasion is calculated from his passive *resolve*, *dexterity*, and *dodge* (proficiency).  
Arnold can rely on his evasion instead of making a roll to avoid being hit.

:::

Sometimes these passive values also act like an automatic test result instead of a difficulty value.

:::info Example

The players enter an area where a small creature is hiding in a bush nearby.  
Rather than requiring the players to make a test (revealing that something is hidden), the game master will instead compare the *passive perception* of their characters against the difficulty to spot the creature.

:::

## Luck

In addition to the dice you roll during a test, you will also roll a d20 called the *luck die*. If the luck die results in a value of *20 or greater*, then you receive a +4 to the result of your roll for that test. This does not guarantee success. Do not roll the luck die for passive tests.

:::caution Important

Do not add the value of your luck die directly to your test roll.

:::

:::info Example

Milo attempts to leap over a 3m pit.  
The game master determines that they will need to roll *dexterity* and *agility* for this test.  
Milo rolls their dexterity and agility for the test while also rolling their luck die.  
Milo rolls a 9 for his test and a 20 on his luck die. He adds a +4 to his roll, resulting in a 13 for his test.

:::

In rare circumstances where only luck is a factor, you may instead be asked to make a *luck test*. If you do, roll the luck die on its own instead of making a normal test.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Circumstance, clever role-playing, or the use of one of your abilities may provide you with *advantage*. For each source of advantage that you have while performing a test, you may reroll one die of your choice and you may keep the better result.

:::info Example

?

:::

Conversely, you may sometimes find yourself with *disadvantage*. If you do, you must instead reroll one die with the greatest result and you *must* keep the worse result.

:::caution Important

Neither advantage or disadvantage can be used to reroll the luck die.

:::

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, then it would require an equal amount of disadvantage to completely cancel out.

## Failure

When a test is performed and does not meet or exceed the difficulty, the test *fails* and the desired outcome is not achieved. However, this does not necessarily result in a dead end or that nothing happens. There may instead be additional consequences for failure, such as escalating risk. In this way, failure is more often a change of circumstances than it is a dead end. Failure should be viewed more as an opportunity to push your luck or explore alternate decisions.

:::info Example

Priscilla attempts to climb the side of a mansion up to the third floor using a rope and grappling hook.  
The game master determines that they will need to roll *strength* and *athletics* for this test.  
With a dexterity of d4 and an ahtletics of d4, Priscilla rolls 2d4.  
Unforunately, her test only results in a value of 4, which is well below the difficulty value, and she fails.

:::

When a test is failed the player usually has three options:

* Escalate the task
* Modify the task
* Abandon the task

### Escalating Tasks

When completing the task is greatly desired, it may be escalated. In this case, the risk of failure is increased as a cost to perform the task again. At most a task may be escalated twice from the initial attempt. This means that the same task may only be performed three times in a row. The first failure is usually safe, the second failure has a small risk, and the third failure has a serious risk.

:::info Example

Priscilla wants to keep climbing the mansion's walls in spite of her lack of ability. She needs to get inside.   
The game master determines that she may keep trying, but with the added risk of falling and receiving injury.

:::

### Modifying Tasks

Instead of escalating a task, it may instead be modified. This means to change the goal of the task, either to something easier or to a different goal entirely.

:::info Example

Priscilla doesn't want to risk an injury trying to climb up to the third floor.  
Instead she decides to change her goal to the second floor.  
The game master determines this to be an easier task.

:::

:::info Example

Fabian attempts to pry a window open but fails.  
Instead of escalating and possibly breaking his tools or jamming the window, he decides to break it open.  
The game master determines this to be much easier but will result in a loud noise and evidence of a break-in.

:::

### Abandoning Tasks

When all else fails, the test must be abandoned. At this point the task can no longer be attempted or completed. Depending on the task this may often exclude others from attempting it as well. This is to be expected if the task needed to be abandoned after being previously escalated.

:::info Example

Fabian attempts to pick a lock but the lock is very complicated and he fails.  
Fabian tries again and escalates twice, but he fails each time.  
The game master determines that the lock becomes completely jammed as a result.  
None of the other characters may attempt to pick the lock.

:::

:::note

This outcome is usually rare unless the task itself was convincingly unlikely from the beginning.  
This is a signal to try out some alternative strategies. Get creative.
