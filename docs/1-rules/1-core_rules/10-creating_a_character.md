title: Creating a Character
---

The process of creating a character is a series of small steps, with each step building a distinct part of your character. No randomization is required during this process<!--, except as an [optional rule](/rules/extended_rules/randomized_characters)-->.

## Archetype

Your _archetype_ is the core that a character is built from and acts as a starting position, rather than a strict limitation.

## Stats

### Attributes

Each character will start with two _good_ attributes and two _weak_ attributes. Good attributes have a value of d6, while weak attributes have a value of d4. If your class requires one or more attributes, you must assign those attributes as good.

### Resources

Each resource is calculated by finding the maximum value of a corresponding attribute.

##### Table: Resource Calculations

| Stat           | Calculation     |
| :------------- | :-------------- |
| Health (HP)    | 6 + Maximum STR |
| Endurance (ED) | 6 + Maximum RES |
| Stamina (ST)   | 6 + Maximum DEX |
| Focus (FC)     | 6 + Maximum INT |

<!--
Alternatively:
HP = Max STR + Max COM
ED = Max RES + Max ATH
ST = Max DEX + Max AGI
FC = Max INT + Max INS
-->

Additionally, each class starts with one of three _talents_ that increases a resource.

##### Table: Resource Talent Bonus

| Talent           | Bonus        |
| :--------------- | :----------- |
| Toughness (+4)   | +4 Endurance |
| Longevity (+4)   | +4 Stamina   |
| Mindfulness (+4) | +4 Focus     |

### Defences

Each defence stat is a combination of your _passive resolve_ and another attribute's passive value. As a reminder, the passive value of a stat is equal to half of its maximum roll.

##### Table: Defence Calculations

| Stat               | Calculation               |
| :----------------- | :------------------------ |
| Constitution (CON) | Passive RES + Passive STR |
| Evasion (EVA)      | Passive RES + Passive DEX |
| Willpower (WILL)   | Passive RES + Passive INT |

### Speed

Your speed is a measurement in _meters_ of how fast your character can move in a _single action_ (2 seconds). <!--Normally, only the base speed matters. However, other speeds can be calculated if necessary.-->

|                | Calculation                                                              |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed          | Size + Passive Dexterity + Passive Agility + Running Proficiency         |
| <!--           | Long Jump                                                                | (Size + Passive Strength + Passive Athletics + Jumping Proficiency) / 3 |
| Vertical Climb | (Size + Passive Strength + Passive Athletics + Climbing Proficiency) / 4 |
| Swimming       | (Size + Passive Strength + Passive Athletics + Swimming Proficiency) / 6 |
| High Jump      | (Size + Passive Strength + Passive Athletics + Jumping Proficiency) / 8  | -->                                                                     |

### Traits

### Motivation

A character's _motivation_ is their primary driving force for why they make their decisions. It should be describable in a couple sentences. Motivations should be capable of roughly answering the following questions:

- What does this character want?
- Why does this character want that?
- How does this character achieve that?

:::info Example

?

:::

Ultimately, a character's motivation will be a source of both conflict and cooperation, as characters will need to make decisions that full their motivations while trying to navigate the conflicting motivations of others.

<!--### Ambition

A character's *ambition* is a long term goal that the character is working toward. These are typically circumstantial or character developmental goals. They can involve specific actions, places, objects, or even other characters. Ambitions do not need to be related to a character's motivation and may instead be designed to fit the current setting.

:::info Example

?

:::

When a character's ambition has been fulfilled it is usually replaced with a new ambition. Alternatively, this can be a good opportunity to retire a character and start another.-->
