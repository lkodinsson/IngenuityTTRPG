## Stats

Stats are any measurable property belonging to a character, typically represented by *dice* or a *number*. Some stats, like *resources* and *defences* are derived from other stats, like *attributes*. They can vary in scope, meaning they can be very broad or very specific.

### Attributes

The most important stat that a character has are their attributes. They describe the core aspects of your character and are used when performing any game action that requires a dice roll.

##### Table: Attributes
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Strength (STR) | Physical ability of raw force and durability |
| Dexterity (DEX) | Physical ability of speed and accuracy |
| Intellect (INT) | Mental ability for discovery and memory |
| Resolve (RES) | Mental ability to command and resist |

Each attribute is represented by dice ranging from d4 to d12.

##### Table: Attribute Dice
| Size | Description |
|:-:|:-|
| d4 | Weak |
| d6 | Average |
| d8 | Great |
| d10 | Excellent |
| d12 | Superb |

:::info Example

A character who is a bodybuilder could be described as having *excellent strength* which would be a d10.

### Resources

Surviving damage and using special abilities requires managing one's *resources*. All resources are represented by a number showing the *maximum* amount of that resource a character can have. Once a resource becomes depleted it can no longer be used until recovered.

##### Table: Resources

| Health (HP) | For lasting injuries that are difficult to heal |
| Endurance (ED) | For superficial injuries that are easy to heal |

:::info Examples

Using the *power* of *telekinesis*, to move objects with the mind, requires spending *focus*.

### Defences

When things happen to your character, your *defences* are used to measure your ability to passively response to those effects.

##### Table: Skill Dice
| Size | Description |
|:-:|:-|
| d4 | Untrained |
| d6 | Trained |

Most tasks are handled by the *mundane* skills. These represent groups of normal activities that most characters can perform while interacting with the world.

##### Table: Mundane Skills

|:-|:-|
| Agility (AGI) | Activities that require speed, precision, and balance |

Other types of tasks that are beyond the normal space of interaction are handled by the *supernatural* skills. This includes abilities both of a magical and nonmagical origin.

### Proficiencies

*Proficiencies* are more precise forms of expertise that a character can learn, like a type of knowledge, specific activity, or familiar environment. Unlike attributes and skills, they are not represented by dice, instead they are represented by a number as a bonus ranging from +1 to +4.

##### Table: Proficiency Bonuses
| Bonus | Description |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| +1 | Trained |
| +2 | Adept |
| +3 | Expert |
| +4 | Master |

A character can have a proficiency in more or less anything that a player can imagine. Proficiencies should be broad enough to be usable in at least a few different activities but specific enough to encompass a single theme. There is also a recommended list of [proficiencies](/rules/reference/proficiences) to help players make decisions and help with consistent theming.

##### Table: Example Proficiencies
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| ? | ... |

Proficiencies are not exclusive, meaning that any other reasonable substitute for a proficiency can be used in the same circumstance. This applies to *all* dice rolls that use proficiencies.

:::info Examples

A character attempting to *ride a horse* could use a proficiency in *riding* or *horses*.  
A character attempting to *track an animal in the woods* could use a proficiency in *tracking* or *woodlands*.

:::

The languages that a character can speak are also a type of proficiency and are acquired and represented the same way. Characters are considered *masters* of their native languages and characters who have mastery in a language never need to roll dice to use it. To simplify language use, all characters are typically considered to share a *common* language.

## Character Archetypes

Your *archetype* is built from three parts that work together to provide a rough summary of who your character is.

##### Table: Archetype Features
| Name | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Ancestry | The culture or genetics that shape your character |
| Background | How your character spent their early life |
| Class | The role your character currently plays |

:::info Examples

Aenwyn is an Elven blacksmith and rogue.  
Baldur is a Dwarven bartender and fighter.  
Crowley is a British scholar and investigator.

:::

Each part of an archetype also provides other small bonuses that help define your character mechanically, like which skills and proficiencies they are trained in.
