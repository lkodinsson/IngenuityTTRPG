## Stats

Stats are any measurable property belonging to a character, typically represented by _dice_ or a _number_. Some stats, like _resources_ and _defences_ are derived from other stats, like _attributes_. They can vary in scope, meaning they can be very broad or very specific.

### Attributes

The most important stat that a character has are their attributes. They describe the core aspects of your character and are used when performing any game action that requires a dice roll.

##### Table: Attributes

| Name            | Description                                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Strength (STR)  | Physical ability of raw force and durability |
| Dexterity (DEX) | Physical ability of speed and accuracy       |
| Intellect (INT) | Mental ability for discovery and memory      |
| Resolve (RES)   | Mental ability to command and resist         |

Each attribute is represented by dice ranging from d4 to d12.

##### Table: Attribute Dice

| Size | Description |
| :--: | :---------- |
|  d4  | Weak        |
|  d6  | Average     |
|  d8  | Great       |
| d10  | Excellent   |
| d12  | Superb      |

:::info Example

A character who is a bodybuilder could be described as having _excellent strength_ which would be a d10.

### Resources

Surviving damage and using special abilities requires managing one's _resources_. All resources are represented by a number showing the _maximum_ amount of that resource a character can have. Once a resource becomes depleted it can no longer be used until recovered.

##### Table: Resources

| Name           | Description                                     |

| Health (HP)    | For lasting injuries that are difficult to heal |
| Endurance (ED) | For superficial injuries that are easy to heal  |
| Stamina (ST)   | To use physical special abilities               |
| Focus (FC)     | To use mental and social special abilities      |
| Fate           | For influencing circumstance and chance         |

:::info Examples

Performing the _escape maneuver_, to hide in plain sight from enemies, requires spending _stamina_.  
Using the _power_ of _telekinesis_, to move objects with the mind, requires spending _focus_.

### Defences

When things happen to your character, your _defences_ are used to measure your ability to passively response to those effects.

##### Table: Defences

| Name               | Description                                                |

| Constitution (CON) | Ability to shrug off effects that would influence the body |
| Evasion (EVA)      | Ability to avoid attacks and effects targeted at the body  |

## Skills

_Skills_ represent practice in performing various groups of general tasks. Like attributes, skills are represented by dice and are rolled with your attributes to perform tasks.

Most tasks are handled by the _mundane_ skills. These represent groups of normal activities that most characters can perform while interacting with the world.

##### Table: Mundane Skills

| Name             | Description                                                            |

| Taming (TAM)     | Communicating with animals and beasts using body language and intent   |

Other types of tasks that are beyond the normal space of interaction are handled by the _supernatural_ skills. This includes abilities both of a magical and nonmagical origin.

##### Table: Supernatural Skills

| Name        | Description                                       |

### Proficiencies

_Proficiencies_ are more precise forms of expertise that a character can learn, like a type of knowledge, specific activity, or familiar environment. Unlike attributes and skills, they are not represented by dice, instead they are represented by a number as a bonus ranging from +1 to +4.

##### Table: Proficiency Bonuses

| Bonus | Description |
| :---: | :---------- |
|   -   | Untrained   |
|  +1   | Trained     |
|  +2   | Adept       |
|  +3   | Expert      |
|  +4   | Master      |

A character can have a proficiency in more or less anything that a player can imagine. Proficiencies should be broad enough to be usable in at least a few different activities but specific enough to encompass a single theme. There is also a recommended list of [proficiencies](/rules/reference/proficiences) to help players make decisions and help with consistent theming.

##### Table: Example Proficiencies

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| ?    | ...         |

Proficiencies are not exclusive, meaning that any other reasonable substitute for a proficiency can be used in the same circumstance. This applies to _all_ dice rolls that use proficiencies.

:::info Examples

A character attempting to _ride a horse_ could use a proficiency in _riding_ or _horses_.  
A character attempting to _track an animal in the woods_ could use a proficiency in _tracking_ or _woodlands_.

:::

The languages that a character can speak are also a type of proficiency and are acquired and represented the same way. Characters are considered _masters_ of their native languages and characters who have mastery in a language never need to roll dice to use it. To simplify language use, all characters are typically considered to share a _common_ language.

## Character Archetypes

Your _archetype_ is built from three parts that work together to provide a rough summary of who your character is.

##### Table: Archetype Features

| Name       | Description                                       |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Ancestry   | The culture or genetics that shape your character |
| Background | How your character spent their early life         |
| Class      | The role your character currently plays           |

:::info Examples

Aenwyn is an Elven blacksmith and rogue.  
Baldur is a Dwarven bartender and fighter.  
Crowley is a British scholar and investigator.

:::

Each part of an archetype also provides other small bonuses that help define your character mechanically, like which skills and proficiencies they are trained in.
