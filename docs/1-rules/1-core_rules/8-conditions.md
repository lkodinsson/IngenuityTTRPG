title: Conditions
---

Occasionally characters suffer effects from attacks, traps, or special abilities. These types of effects are called *conditions*.

##### Table: Conditions

```mdx-code-block
import YAMLTable from '@site/src/components/YAMLTable';
import tableData from '@site/src/components/tables/conditions.yml';

<YAMLTable tableData={tableData}/>
```

By default, conditions are temporary and a character cannot have multiple instances of the same condition unless otherwise specified. Usually this means that the newest or most powerful instance of a condition takes precedence.

Normally when a condition is applied, it will specify a duration or a circumstance that allows the condition to expire. If it does not, then it is usually lasts for the duration of the scene or until it loses relevance.
