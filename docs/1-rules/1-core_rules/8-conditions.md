Occasionally characters suffer effects from attacks, traps, or special abilities. These types of effects are called *conditions*.

| Unconscious | Become prone. Incapacitated while unconscious |
<!--| Overencumbered | Like encumbered, but cannot move |-->

By default, conditions are temporary and a character cannot have multiple instances of the same condition unless otherwise specified. Usually this means that the newest or most powerful instance of a condition takes precedence.

Normally when a condition is applied, it will specify a duration or a circumstance that allows the condition to expire. If it does not, then it is usually lasts for the duration of the scene or until it loses relevance.
