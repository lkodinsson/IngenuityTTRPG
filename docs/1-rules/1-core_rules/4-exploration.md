## Point Travel

<!--As the players move from one location to another 

When the characters are moving from one location to another to enter into new scenes, this is called a *point crawl*. This refers to the movement from one point to another.-->

<!--
In combat players have a limited amount that they can use on their turn.
Even actions that are typically used in combat, like *defensive actions*, can also be used outside of combat if the context of the scene is appropriate.
-->

<!--## Time

Performing tasks also requires time. The amount of time required can be just a few seconds, 10 minutes, or a whole hour. The more tasks that are attempted, the more time that is spent. As time passes, the current situation will often advance or change, presenting new and sometimes more difficult challenges for the players.

:::info Example

The players enter a new room filled with lots of things to interact with and information to collect.  
For each task the players take while in the room, time will pass.  
Whenever certain amounts of time pass, the game master may make hidden tests to determine potential new challenges.
