title: Powers
---

Powers are associated with _supernatural skills_, require spending a resource like _stamina_ or _focus_, and must be individually learned before they can be used. They can only be learned by characters with both a matching skill _and_ proficiency. Powers are separated into _tiers_ and each tier requires a specific rank of a skill and proficiency before they can be learned.

##### Table: Power Tiers

| Tier |     Name     |  Skill   | Proficiency |
| :--: | :----------: | :------: | :---------: | --- | --- |
|  1   |    Basic     |    d6    |     +1      |
|  2   | Intermediate |    d8    |     +2      |
|  3   |   Advanced   |   d10    |     +3      |
| <!-- |      4       | Ultimate |     d12     | +4  | --> |

Powers can only be used with the specific skill that they were learned for. In order to use them with a different skill, they must be learned again for the other skill. Powers do not need to be learned again to be used with the same skill but different proficiency.

Each of the supernatural skills that provide access to powers use them in different ways. Some of them may require that you spend _stamina_ while others might require _focus_. Some of these skills might describe the use of those powers as _magical_ while some might describe them as _nonmagical_. In any case, they generally follow the same steps:

- Wait for the complete action time
- Pay a resource cost based on their skill and tier
- Make a test with a listed skill and proficiency
- Compare that test to the power's difficulty based on its tier
- Apply the effect of the power based on the test

All manuevers require a test to determine the degree of their effect and many of these are made as contests against other characters.

### Power Tiers

The type of resource used is determined by the skill providing the power, while the amount of that resource is determined by the power's tier. In order to successfully use a power, the test made to use them must also beat a difficulty based on their tier.

##### Table: Power Tiers

| Tier |     Name     |   Cost   |  Difficulty  |
| :--: | :----------: | :------: | :----------: | ---------------- | --- |
|  1   |    Basic     |    1     |  4 (Simple)  |
|  2   | Intermediate |    2     | 6 (Standard) |
|  3   |   Advanced   |    3     | 8 (Moderate) |
| <!-- |      4       | Ultimate |      4       | 10 (Challenging) | --> |

Powers get a -2 penalty for each power made before it during the same round. This is known as the _multiple power penalty_. Typically this only occurs in combat.

### Powers as Attacks

Many powers allow you to make attacks that deliver additional effects. Attacks are made this way by using the result of the test for that power (if it is successful) as the roll for your attack.

Attacks made this way are made as normal then provide an additional effect if they hit their target. When they do, you compare the result of your power test from your attack against a specified defence from that target. If that also succeeds, you apply the additional effect. No additional roll is required unless the power specifies multiple tests.

Attacks made by powers are _not_ subject to the _multiple attack penalty_ like normal attacks. Instead they are only subject to the _multiple power penalty_.

### Modifying Powers

?

<!--Remove metapowers, instead put all those rules here-->
<!--Also add an option to spend 1 focus to reduce the difficulty value of the power by 2-->
<!--Modification points: passive value of power skill + proficiency for the power being used (minimum 2 (untrained, nonproficient), maximum 10 (double master))-->
