title: Actions
---

Any task or active ability that a character uses can be considered a type of _action_ and all actions require some amount of _time_ to complete. Different types of circumstances provide characters with various amounts of time to complete actions. While most actions require very little time, many complex or difficult tasks can require anywhere from 10 minutes to multiple hours to complete.

:::note

Time is a resource. Plan accordingly.

:::

## Scenes

When the game master describes the world for the players to interact, they are setting the _scene_. Once in a scene, players may take turns taking actions in any order they choose. Collectively those actions will take the characters about 5 to 10 minutes while in the scene.

:::tip Optional

The time spent during a scene can be ignored unless there is explicit time pressure or a risk of danger.

## Defensive Actions

Before a character receives an attack they may decide to react with a _defensive action_, which is any reaction that allows you to _block_, _dodge_, _fortify_, _parry_, or _resist_.

### Dodge

When you _dodge_ an attack, instead of using your evasion, make a test using your dexterity attribute, agility skill, and dodge proficiency. If your result is less than your evasion, use your evasion instead.

:::info Example

Fabian is attacked but does not want to receive damage, so he attempts to dodge the attack.  
The enemy rolls to attack, resulting in a 7.  
Fabian rolls his dexterity (d6) and agility skill (d4), then adds his dodge proficiency (+1), resulting in an 8.  
If Fabian did not dodge the attack, the enemy would have beaten his evasion of 4. Instead, he manages to dodge the attack.  
After he dodges, he decides to move 1m away from the attacker, making it harder to be attacked again.

:::

After you dodge, even if you fail, you may drop prone, seek cover, and/or move up to 1m.

### Fortify

When you _fortify_ against an effect, instead of using your constitution, make a test using your strength attribute, athletics skill, and fortitude proficiency. If your result is less than your constitution, use your constitution instead.

### Resist

When you _resist_ against an effect, instead of using your willpower, make a test using your intelligence attribute, insight skill, and resistance proficiency. If your result is less than your willpower, use your willpower instead.

<!--## Defence Tests

When a passive test fails that involves a *defence* stat, players may pay *stamina* or *focus* to make a *defence test* to try again to prevent any negative effects.

##### Table: Defence Tests
| Stat | Cost | Test |
|:-|:-:|:-|
| Constitution | 1 ST | Strength (Attribute) + Athletics (Skill) + Fortitude (Proficiency) |
| Evasion | 1 ST | Dexterity (Attribute) + Agility (Skill) + Dodge (Proficiency) |
| Willpower | 1 FC | Intelligence (Attribute) + Insight (Skill) + Resistance (Proficiency) |

> ***Example***
> Gundahar walks into a room, which begins to fill with *poisonous spores*.
> The difficulty to prevent the poison is greater than their *fortitude*, so they will become poisoned.
> The player controlling Gundahar wants to prevent this, so they attempt a *defence test*.
> Since the poison is being compared to their fortitude, they will need to spend 1 *stamina*, then roll their *strength*, plus their *athletics* skill, plus their *resilience* proficiency.

If this defence test fails, you may not try again by spending more resources.-->

### Block and Parry

## Fate Actions

At any time, 1 point of _fate_ may be spent to achieve any one of the following effects:

- Ask the game master any one question about the current scene, which they must answer truthfully
- Maximize a single die during one of your tests (including the luck die)
- Take an additional action during your turn in combat
- Choose one of endurance, stamina, or focus, to recover by half of their maximum
- Reduce a single source of damage taken to half (after damage reduction)
- Perform a character advancement during the current scene, reducing the experience cost to half
    <!--* Prevent your character from dying at the cost of inhibiting their motivation or ambition-->
