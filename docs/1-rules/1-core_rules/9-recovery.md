title: Recovery
---

During your adventures you may find yourself low on your resources. In order to recover them you will need to take either a *break* or a *rest*.

## Breaks

A break is a short amount of time spent not performing any strenuous activities. Whenever you go to relax, meditate, or make simple preparations over a period of about thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a break. After a successful break, each of your *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, each recover by half of their maximum.

:::info Example

After taking a break, if your maximum endurance is 10, then you will recover 5 endurance.

:::

Additionally, breaks may contain a single simple activity such as performing research or crafting an item. The task in question must be easy (difficulty of 4 or less) and the time required for the break is extended to require at least two hours.

:::info Example

Justinia decides to visit the local library to read up on books about the occult.  
She spends several hours there reading books to discover clues.  
The singular task was both simple and easy, so she was able to recover some focus that she spent earlier in the session.

:::

Breaks can only be taken up to *two* times in between each rest.

## Rests

A rest is a large amount of time usually spent sleeping for approximately eight hours. After a successful rest, each of your *endurance*, *stamina*, and *focus*, each recover an amount equal to their maximum. Additionally, *health* recovers by exactly 1 and any special abilities that can be used a number of times per rest recover all of their uses.

If rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered an *incomplete rest* and only half of the normal amount of endurance, stamina, and focus are recovered. The rest may be resumed within a couple hours to properly rest and recover all of the remaining resources.

:::info Example

Haldir sets up camp and sleeps for the night.  
He awakens in the middle of the night to a wolf eating his food supplies.  
He recovers only half of his endurance, stamina, and focus. He does not recover any health or uses of his *second wind* talent.  
If he can deal with the wolf and return to sleep soon, then he will be able to recover the rest of his resources.

:::

Rests can only be taken up to once each day (usually at night).

:::tip Optional

Failure to eat, drink, or sleep can lead to [fatigue](/rules/extended_rules/fatigue). Tracking fatigue is an optional rule.

## Fate

Unlike other resources, fate does *not* recover during a rest or a break. Instead, characters gain 1 fate at the beginning of each game session. Spend them *wisely*.

Characters cannot have more than 3 fate at one time. If a character already has 3 fate when they gain another, then they gain zero fate instead.
