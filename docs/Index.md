# What is Ingenuity?

**_Ingenuity_** ([/ˌɪnd͡ʒəˈn(j)uːəti/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation)) _The ability to solve difficult problems in original, clever, and inventive ways._

Ingenuity is a free [generic role-playing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_role-playing_game_system). One player (as the _game master_ or _GM_) describes situation and the events that occur, while the other players (as the _characters_) describe their goals and actions. Difficult actions may require dice rolls to determine their success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Ingenuity uses standard [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) to describe what dice to roll. It can be played in various genres and has optional rules to suit your group's preferences.

## Why Ingenuity?

Ingenuity is about customization. As a game master, you have the ability to customize the rules of the game world and the experience you seek to provide to your players. As a player, you have the ability to customize the thematic and mechanical ways you interact with the game world. The goal is use a small number of interconnected systems with customization options rather than a large number of disparate complex systems; once you learn how the game works you can begin customizing your experience. Ingenuity is ideal for people who want verisimilitude but low complexity.
