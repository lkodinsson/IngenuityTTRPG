# What is Ingenuity?

**Ingenuity** ([/ˌɪnd͡ʒəˈn(j)uːəti/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation)) *The ability to solve difficult problems in original, clever, and inventive ways.*

Ingenuity is a free [generic role-playing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_role-playing_game_system). One player (the *game master* or *GM*) describes situation and the events that occur, while the other players (the *characters*) describe their goals and actions. Difficult actions may require dice rolls to determine their success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Ingenuity uses standard [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) to describe what dice to roll. It can be played in various genres and has optional rules to suit your group's preferences.

#### Why Ingenuity?

Ingenuity is about customization. As a game master, you have the ability to customize the rules of the game world and the experience you seek to provide to your players. As a player, you have the ability to customize the thematic and mechanical ways you interact with the game world. The goal is use a small number of interconnected systems with customization options rather than a large number of disparate complex systems; once you learn how the game works you can begin customizing your experience. Ingenuity is ideal for people who want verisimilitude but low complexity.

#### Learning to Play

The first chapter of the core rules, [Introduction](/Core_Rules/Introduction), is a great place to start learning the rules of the game. From there it transitions directly into [Creating a Character](/Core_Rules/Creating_a_Character) and then [Advancing a Character](/Core_Rules/Advancing_a_Character). Depending on the setting and content that you play, you may have different options available for creating and advancing characters. Always ask your game master what content is allowed to be used. In the sidebar there are links for information on the various character features. <!--Even more details can be found in the appendix, such as the [glossary](/Appendix/Glossary), [expanded tables](/Appendix/Expanded_Tables), a [changelog](/Appendix/Changelog), and other information (also in the sidebar).-->

<!--For those that want more advanced rules systems there is an entire subsection for optional rules designed to expand various parts of the game available in the sidebar.

> ***Example***
> [Character Flaws](/Extended_Systems/Character_Flaws) are an optional rule that allows you to give characters drawbacks in exchange for additional starting experience to expand your abilities during character creation, or [Epic Characters](/Extended_Systems/Epic_Characters) which is a ruleset that allows you to extend the limits of character advancement to play more powerful characters as demigods or super heroes by providing more experience as rewards and increasing the maximum limit of stats and skills-->.
