#### Automaton

Automatons are quite rare, as they are not naturally occuring creatures. They are typically constructed by exceptional artificers and are usually found in their accompaniment, if not found lost and abandoned. They require regular maintenance and if found are usually capable of repairing themselves if not accompanied by an artificer.

**Stats** Automatons get a +1 bonus to any two primary stats.

**Construct** The automaton's body is constructed of various artificial materials and does not perform normal biological functions. They are no longer required to eat, drink, or sleep, and do not recover 1 health after a rest. They may be repaired during a rest using the craft skill the same way a normal creature would using the medicine skill. Additionally, if they would be repaired by a special ability (like the [Mend](/Features/Powers#mend) power), they also recover an additional 1 health.

The automaton also gets natural armour as a part of its body, which can be modified like any other armour, or replaced by any other metal armour type. This natural armour only applies its armour rating and damage reduction if they are greater than any body armour that they are also wearing. By default the natural armour provides 2 armour rating and damage reduction. This armour is treated as having a cost of 70 for the purposes of crafting upgrades onto it. This armour considered to be a part of its body, is not considered to be worn.

**Adaptive Vision** Over a period of about a minute, automatons can adapt their vision to that of either dark vision or low-light vision.

**Size** Automatons are typically medium sized (5).

#### Lizardfolk

Typically found dwelling in dark and damp environments, they do not often interact with many other humanoid species. While their environment does play a major role in their seclusion, they often choose not to seek out interaction. Lizardfolk live for extended periods of time and can recover quickly from injuries, which provides their civilizations with a greater concentration of surviving elders. As a result lizardfolk find a greater comfort in the wisdom of their own elders than seeking insight from other races. Despite this however, their lack of communication often leaves them behind technologically and culturally.

**Stats** Lizardfolk get +1 Dexterity and +1 Resolve.

**Dark Vision** Lizardfolk can see in both areas devoid of light and poorly lit areas with ease, but cannot see in broad daylight.

**Size** Lizardfolk are medium sized.

**Speed** Lizardfolk have a movement speed of 6m.

**Languages** Lizardfolk start with the common and lizardfolk languages.

#### Orc

Known for their imposing demeanor, orcs they are often mistakenly labelled as brutes. While their strength is often true, they are just as varied and capable as other races. Although they are not brutes, this misconception can be used in their favour to more easily manipulate those who do not know any better.

#### Mycelian

Mycelians are mobile fungus folk roughly in the shape of humanoids. The bodies of individual mycelians can vary wildly but always follow a basic layout of two arms and two legs. They do not have mouths, rendering them entirely incapable of verbal communication. Within their race, mycelians communicate telepathically with one another, and some individuals also learn sign language to more easily converse with other races. Ancient elder mycelians can be much larger than normal mycelians, but are rooted in the ground and unable to move. These ancient elder mycelians are the progenitors of other mycelians.

**Stats** Mycelians get +1 Intelligence and Resolve.

**Adaptation: Spores** Mycelians get a +1 bonus to medicine, but at the cost of a -1 penalty to agility.

**Fungal Body** Mycelians cannot speak normally, but can speak telepathically to any living thing they are directly touching, as long as the recipient is willing. This communication does not require that both creatures speak the same languages, but some may find it intrusive. The sporecap on their head prevents them from wearing any kind of headgear, but they can emit spores to identify the position of nearby creatures regardless of lighting conditions.

**Grit** Mycelians get a +1 bonus to maximum endurance, stamina, and focus.

**Size** Mycelians are typically medium sized.

**Speed** Mycelians have a movement speed of 5m.
